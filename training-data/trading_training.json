This concept is known as limit price since that price is limited to\nthe worst price the order can execute at.\nAn IOC order will continue matching against orders on the order side until one of the\nfollowing happens:\n\u2022 The entire quantity on the IOC order is executed.\n\u2022 The price of the passive order on the other side is worse than the IOC order's price.\n\u2022 The IOC order is partially executed, and the remaining quantity expires.\nAn IOC order that is sent at a price better than the best available order on the other side\n(that is, the buy order is lower than the best offer price, or the sell order is higher than the\nbest bid price) does not execute at all and just expires.\nGTC orders\nGTC orders can persist indefinitely and require a specific cancellation order.\nLimit order books\nThe exchange accepts order requests from all market participants and maintains them in\na limit order book. Limit order books are a view into all the market participant's visible\norders available at the exchange at any point in time.\nBuy orders (or bids) are arranged from the highest price (that is, the best price) to the\nlowest price (that is, the worst price), and Ask orders (that is, asks or offers) are arranged\nfrom the lowest price (that is, the best price) to the highest price (that is, the lowest price).\nThe highest bid prices are considered the best bid prices because buy orders with the\nhighest buy prices are the first to be matched, and the reverse is true for ask prices, that is,\nsell orders with the lowest sell prices match first.",

    "output": "12 Introduction to Algorithmic Trading\nIt has also been observed that short-term volatile moves in either direction often tend to\nrevert to their previous market price, leading to mean reversion-based speculators and\ntrading strategies. Similarly, historical observations that similar product prices move\ntogether, which also makes intuitive sense have led to the generation of correlation and\ncollinearity-based trading strategies such as statistical arbitrage and pairs trading strategies.\nSince every market participant uses different trading strategies, the final market prices\nreflect the majority of market participants. Trading strategies whose views align with\nthe majority of market participants are profitable under those conditions. A single\ntrading strategy generally cannot be profitable 100 percent of the time, so sophisticated\nparticipants have a portfolio of trading strategies.\nTrading signals\nTrading signals are also referred to as features, calculators, indicators, predictors, or alpha.\nTrading signals are what drive algorithmic trading strategy decisions. Signals are\nwell-defined pieces of intelligence derived from market data, alternative data (such as\nnews, social media feeds, and more), and even our own order flow, which is designed to\npredict certain market conditions in the future.\nSignals almost always originate from some intuitive idea and observation of certain\nmarket conditions and/or strategy performance. Often, most quantitative developers\nspend most of their time researching and developing new trading signals to improve\nprofitability under different market conditions and to improve the algorithmic trading\nstrategy overall.\nThe trading signal research framework\nA lot of man-hours are invested in researching and discovering new signals to improve\ntrading performance. To do that in a systematic, efficient, scalable, and scientific manner,\noften, the first step is to build a good signal research framework.\nThis framework has subcomponents for the following:\n\u2022 Data generation is based on the signal we are trying to build and the market\nconditions/objectives we are trying to capture/predict. In most real-world\nalgorithmic trading, we use tick data, which is data that represents every single\nevent in the market. As you might imagine, there are a lot of events every day and\nthis leads to massive amounts of data, so you also need to think about subsampling\nthe data received. Subsampling has several advantages, such as reducing the scale\nof data, eliminating the noise/spurious patches of data, and highlighting interesting/\nimportant data.",

In the following\ncode example, we see that even though integer data values were provided, the resulting\nndarray has dtype as bool, since the data type was specified to be np.bool:\nnp.array([-1, 0, 1], dtype=np.bool)\nThe values are shown here:\narray([ True, False, True])\nWe observe that the integer values (-1, 0, 1) were converted to bool values (True,\nFalse, True). 0 gets converted to False, and all other values get converted to True.",

We use a pair of series\nvalues returned to generate a DataFrame with Price, hp_cycle, and hp_trend fields\nto represent the price, the seasonal component, and the trend components, as illustrated\nin the following code snippet:\nhp_cycle, hp_trend = \\\nsm.tsa.filters.hpfilter(dataset['Price'], lamb=129600)\ndecomp = dataset[['Price']]\ndecomp['HP_Cycle'] = hp_cycle\ndecomp['HP_Trend'] = hp_trend",

    "output": "246 Fundamental Algorithmic Trading Strategies\nWhat is an algorithmic trading strategy?\nAny algorithmic trading strategy should entail the following:\n\u2022 It should be a model based on an underlying market theory since only then can you\nfind its predictive power. Fitting a model to data with great backtesting results is\nsimple, but usually does not provide sound predictions.\n\u2022 It should be as simple as possible - the more complex the strategy, the less likely it is\nto perform well in the long term (overfitting).\n\u2022 It should restrict the strategy for a well-defined set of financial assets (trading\nuniverse) based on the following:\na) Their returns profile.\nb) Their returns not being correlated.\nc) Their trading patterns - you do not want to trade an illiquid asset; you restrict\nyourself just to significantly traded assets.\n\u2022 It should define the relevant financial data:\na) Frequency: Daily, monthly, intraday, and suchlike\nb) Data source\n\u2022 It should define the model's parameters.\n\u2022 It should define their timing, entry, exit rules, and position sizing strategy - for\nexample, we cannot trade more than 10% of the average daily volume; usually, the\ndecision to enter/exit is made by a composition of several indicators.\n\u2022 It should define the risk levels - how much of a risk a single asset can bear.\n\u2022 It should define the benchmark used to compare performance against.\n\u2022 It should define its rebalancing policy - as the markets evolve, the position sizes\nand risk levels will deviate from their target levels and then it is necessary to adjust\nthe portfolios.\nUsually, you have a large library of algorithmic trading strategies, and backtesting will\nsuggest which of these strategies, on which assets, and at what point in time they may\ngenerate a profit. Y ou should keep a backtesting journal to keep track of what strategies\ndid or didn't work, on what stock, and during what period.",

Imagine risking\nsay 50 points for 400 points profits.\nUsing this price action strategy will help you predict proper turni ng\npoints in the market in advance and understand how banks and\nfinancial institutions trade the market.",
