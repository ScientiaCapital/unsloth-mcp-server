      "text": "THE NEW RULES\nwas intimidated. I'd spent more than two decades in the FBI, including fifteen years negotiating hostage situations from New York to the Philippines and the Middle East, and I was on top of my game. At any given time, there are ten thousand FBI agents in the Bureau, but only one lead international kidnapping negotiator. That was me. But I'd never experienced a hostage situation so tense, so personal. \"We've got your son, Voss. Give us one million dollars or he dies.\"\nPause. Blink. Mindfully urge the heart rate back to normal. Sure, I'd been in these types of situations before. Tons of them. Money for lives. But not like this. Not with my son on the line. Not $1 million. And not against people with fancy degrees and a lifetime of negotiating expertise. You see, the people across the table-my negotiating counterparts-were Harvard Law School negotiating professors. I'd come up to Harvard to take a short executive negotiating course, to see if I could learn something from the business world's approach. It was supposed to be quiet and calm, a little professional development for an FBI guy trying to widen his horizons. But when Robert Mnookin, the director of the Harvard Negotiation Research Project, learned I was on campus, he invited me to his office for a coffee. Just to chat, he said. I was honored. And scared. Mnookin is an impressive guy whom I'd followed for years: not only is he a Harvard law professor, he's also one of the big shots of the conflict resolution field and the author of\nBargaining with the Devil: When to Negotiate, When to Fight\nTo be honest, it felt unfair that Mnookin wanted me, a former Kansas City beat cop, to debate negotiation with him. But then it got worse. Just after Mnookin and I sat down, the door opened and another Harvard professor walked in. It was Gabriella Blum, a specialist in international negotiations, armed conflict, and counterterrorism, who'd spent eight years as a negotiator for the Israeli National Security Council and the Israel Defense Forces. The tough-as-nails IDF. On cue, Mnookin's secretary arrived and put a tape recorder on the table. Mnookin and Blum smiled at me. I'd been tricked. \"We've got your son, Voss. Give us one million dollars or he dies,\" Mnookin said, smiling. \"I'm the kidnapper. What are you going to do?\"\nI experienced a flash of panic, but that was to be expected. It never changes: even after two decades negotiating for human lives you still feel fear. Even in a role-playing situation. I calmed myself down. Sure, I was a street cop turned FBI agent playing against real heavyweights. And I wasn't a genius. But I was in this room for a reason. Over the years I had picked up skills, tactics, and a whole approach to human interaction that had not just helped me save lives but, as I recognize now looking back, had also begun to transform my own life. My years of negotiating had infused everything from how I dealt with customer service reps to my parenting style. \"C'mon. Get me the money or I cut your son's throat right now,\" Mnookin said. Testy. I gave him a long, slow stare. Then I smiled. \"How am I supposed to do that?\"\nMnookin paused. His expression had a touch of amused pity in it, like a dog when the cat it's been chasing turns around and tries to chase it back. It was as if we were playing different games, with different rules. Mnookin regained his composure and eyed me with arched brows as if to remind me that we were still playing. \"So you're okay with me killing your son, Mr. Voss?\"\n\"I'm sorry, Robert, how do I know he's even alive?\" I said, using an apology and his first name, seeding more warmth into the interaction in order to complicate his gambit to bulldoze me. \"I really am sorry, but how can I get you any money right now, much less one million dollars, if I don't even know he's alive?\"\nIt was quite a sight to see such a brilliant man flustered by what must have seemed unsophisticated foolishness. On the contrary, though, my move was anything but foolish. I was employing what had become one of the FBI's most potent negotiating tools: the open-ended question. Today, after some years evolving these tactics for the private sector in my consultancy, The Black Swan Group, we call this tactic calibrated questions: queries that the other side can respond to but that have no fixed answers. It buys you time. It gives your counterpart the illusion of control-they are the one with the answers and power after all-and it does all that without giving them any idea of how constrained they are by it. Mnookin, predictably, started fumbling because the frame of the conversation had shifted from how I'd respond to the threat of my son's murder to how the professor would deal with the logistical issues involved in getting the money. How he would solve\nproblems. To\nevery threat and demand he made, I continued to ask how I was supposed to pay him and how was I supposed to know that my son was alive. After we'd been doing that for three minutes, Gabriella Blum interjected. \"Don't let him do that to you,\" she said to Mnookin. try,\" he said, throwing up his hands. Blum dove in. She was tougher from her years in the Middle East. But she was still doing the bulldozer angle, and all she got were my same questions. Mnookin rejoined the session, but he got nowhere either. His face started to get red with frustration. I could tell the irritation was making it hard to think. \"Okay, okay, Bob. That's all,\" I said, putting him out of his misery. He nodded. My son would live to see another day. \"Fine,\" he said.",

I had taken on the best of the best and come out on top. But was it just a fluke? For more than three decades, Harvard had been the world epicenter of negotiating theory and practice. All I knew about the techniques we used at the FBI was that they worked. In the twenty years I spent at the Bureau we'd designed a system that had successfully resolved almost every kidnapping we applied it to. But we didn't have grand theories. Our techniques were the products of experiential learning; they were developed by agents in the field, negotiating through crisis and sharing stories of what succeeded and what failed. It was an iterative process, not an intellectual one, as we refined the tools we used day after day. And it was urgent. Our tools\nto work, because if they didn't someone died. did they work? That was the question that drew me to Harvard, to that office with Mnookin and Blum. I lacked confidence outside my narrow world. Most of all, I needed to articulate my knowledge and learn how to combine it with theirs-and they clearly had some-so I could understand, systematize, and expand it. Yes, our techniques clearly worked with mercenaries, drug dealers, terrorists, and brutal killers. But, I wondered, what about with normal humans? As I'd soon discover in the storied halls of Harvard, our techniques made great sense intellectually, and they worked\neverywhere\nIt turned out that our approach to negotiation held the keys to unlock profitable human interactions in every domain and every interaction and every relationship in life. This book is how it works. THE SMARTEST DUMB GUY IN THE ROOM\nTo answer my questions, a year later, in 2006, I talked my way into Harvard Law School's Winter Negotiation Course. The best and brightest compete to get into this class, and it was filled with brilliant Harvard students getting law and business degrees and hotshot students from other top Boston universities like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Tufts. The Olympic trials for negotiating. And I was the only outsider. The first day of the course, all 144 of us piled into a lecture hall for an introduction and then we split into four groups, each led by a negotiation instructor. After we'd had a chat with our instructor-mine was named Sheila Heen, and she's a good buddy to this day-we were partnered off in pairs and sent into mock negotiations. Simple: one of us was selling a product, the other was the buyer, and each had clear limits on the price they could take. My counterpart was a languid redhead named Andy (a pseudonym), one of those guys who wear their intellectual superiority like they wear their khakis: with relaxed confidence. He and I went into an empty classroom overlooking one of those English-style squares on Harvard's campus, and we each used the tools we had. Andy would throw out an offer and give a rationally airtight explanation for why it was a good one-an inescapable logic trap-and I'd answer with some variation of \"How am I supposed to do that?\"\nWe did this a bunch of times until we got to a final figure. When we left, I was happy. I thought I'd done pretty well for a dumb guy. After we all regrouped in the classroom, Sheila went around the students and asked what price each group had agreed on, and then wrote the result on the board. Finally, it was my turn. \"Chris, how did you do with Andy?\" she asked. \"How much did you get?\"\nI'll never forget Sheila's expression when I told her what Andy had agreed to pay. Her whole face first went red, as if she couldn't breathe, and then out popped a little strangled gasp like a baby bird's hungry cry. Finally, she started to laugh. Andy squirmed. \"You got literally every dime he had,\" she said, \"and in his brief he was supposed to hold a quarter of it back in reserve for future work.\"\nAndy sank deep in his chair. The next day the same thing happened with another partner. I mean, I absolutely destroyed the guy's budget. It didn't make sense. A lucky one-off was one thing. But this was a pattern. With my old-school, experiential knowledge, I was killing guys who knew every cutting-edge trick you could find in a book. The thing was, it was the cutting-edge techniques these guys were using that felt dated and old. I felt like I was Roger Federer and I had\nused a time machine to go back to the 1920s to play in a tennis tournament of distinguished gentlemen who wore white pantsuits and used wood rackets and had part-time training regimens. There I was with my titanium alloy racket and dedicated personal trainer and computer-strategized serve-and-volley plays. The guys I was playing were just as smart-actually, more so-and we were basically playing the same game with the same rules. But I had skills they didn't. \"You're getting famous for your special style, Chris,\" Sheila said, after I announced my second day's results. I smiled like the Cheshire cat. Winning was fun. \"Chris, why don't you tell everybody your approach,\" Sheila said.",

Is it really that easy?\"\nI knew what she meant: While I wasn't actually saying \"No,\" the questions I kept asking sounded like it. They seemed to insinuate that the other side was being dishonest and unfair. And that was enough to make them falter and negotiate with themselves. Answering my calibrated questions demanded deep emotional strengths and tactical psychological insights that the toolbox they'd been given did not contain. I shrugged. \"I'm just asking questions,\" I said. \"It's a passive-aggressive approach. I just ask the same three or four open-ended questions over and over and over and over. They get worn out answering and give me everything I want.\"\nAndy jumped in his seat as if he'd been stung by a bee. \"Damn!\" he said. \"\nwhat happened. I had no idea.\"\nBy the time I'd finished my winter course at Harvard, I'd actually become friends with some of my fellow students. Even with Andy. If my time at Harvard showed me anything, it was that we at the FBI had a lot to teach the world about negotiating. In my short stay I realized that without a deep understanding of human psychology, without the acceptance that we are all crazy, irrational, impulsive, emotionally driven animals, all the raw intelligence and mathematical logic in the world is little help in the fraught, shifting interplay of two people negotiating. Yes, perhaps we are the only animal that haggles-a monkey does not exchange a portion of his banana for another's nuts-but no matter how we dress up our negotiations in mathematical theories, we are always an animal, always acting and reacting first and foremost from our deeply held but mostly invisible and inchoate fears, needs, perceptions, and desires. That's not how these folks at Harvard learned it, though. Their theories and techniques all had to do with intellectual power, logic, authoritative acronyms like BATNA and ZOPA, rational notions of value, and a moral concept of what was fair and what was not. And built on top of this false edifice of rationality was, of course, process. They had a script to follow, a predetermined sequence of actions, offers, and counteroffers designed in a specific order to bring about a particular outcome. It was as if they were dealing with a robot, that if you did\nin a certain fixed order, you would get\n. But in the real world negotiation is far too unpredictable and complex for that. You may have to do\n, and then maybe\nIf I could dominate the country's brightest students with just one of the many emotionally attuned negotiating techniques I had developed and used against terrorists and kidnappers, why not apply them to business? What was the difference between bank robbers who took hostages and CEOs who used hardball tactics to drive down the price of a billion-dollar acquisition? After all, kidnappers are just businessmen trying to get the best price. OLD-SCHOOL NEGOTIATION\nHostage taking-and therefore hostage negotiating-has existed since the dawn of recorded time. The Old Testament spins plenty of tales of Israelites and their enemies taking each other's citizens hostage as spoils of war. The Romans, for their part, used to force the princes of vassal states to send their sons to Rome for their education, to ensure the continued loyalty of the princes. But until the Nixon administration, hostage negotiating as a process was limited to sending in troops and trying to shoot the hostages free. In law enforcement, our approach was pretty much to talk until we figured out how to take them out with a gun. Brute force. Then a series of hostage disasters forced us to change. In 1971, thirty-nine hostages were killed when the police tried to resolve the Attica prison riots in upstate New York with guns. Then at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, eleven Israeli athletes and coaches were killed by their Palestinian captors after a botched rescue attempt by the German police. But the greatest inspiration for institutional change in American law enforcement came on an airport tarmac in Jacksonville, Florida, on October 4, 1971. The United States was experiencing an epidemic of airline hijackings at the time; there were five in one three-day period in 1970. It was in that charged atmosphere that an unhinged man named George Giffe Jr. hijacked a chartered plane out of Nashville, Tennessee, planning to head to the Bahamas. By the time the incident was over, Giffe had murdered two hostages-his estranged wife and the pilot-and killed himself to boot. But this time the blame didn't fall on the hijacker; instead, it fell squarely on the FBI. Two hostages had managed to convince Giffe to let them go on the tarmac in Jacksonville, where they'd stopped to\nrefuel. But the agents had gotten impatient and shot out the engine. And that had pushed Giffe to the nuclear option. In fact, the blame placed on the FBI was so strong that when the pilot's wife and Giffe's daughter filed a wrongful death suit alleging FBI negligence, the courts agreed. In the landmark\nDowns v. United States\ndecision of 1975, the U.S.",

And that had pushed Giffe to the nuclear option. In fact, the blame placed on the FBI was so strong that when the pilot's wife and Giffe's daughter filed a wrongful death suit alleging FBI negligence, the courts agreed. In the landmark Downs v. United States decision of 1975, the U.S. Court of Appeals wrote that \"there was a better suited alternative to protecting the hostages' well-being,\" and said that the FBI had turned \"what had been a successful 'waiting game,' during which two persons safely left the plane, into a 'shooting match' that left three persons dead.\" The court concluded that \"a reasonable attempt at negotiations must be made prior to a tactical intervention.\"\nThe Downs hijacking case came to epitomize everything\nto do in a crisis situation, and inspired the development of today's theories, training, and techniques for hostage negotiations. Soon after the Giffe tragedy, the New York City Police Department (NYPD) became the first police force in the country to put together a dedicated team of specialists to design a process and handle crisis negotiations. The FBI and others followed. A new era of negotiation had begun. HEART VS. MIND\nIn the early 1980s, Cambridge, Massachusetts, was\nhot spot in the negotiating world, as scholars from different disciplines began interacting and exploring exciting new concepts. The big leap forward came in 1979, when the Harvard Negotiation Project was founded with a mandate to improve the theory, teaching, and practice of negotiation so that people could more effectively handle everything from peace treaties to business mergers. Two years later, Roger Fisher and William Ury-cofounders of the\nproject-came out with\nGetting to Yes\na groundbreaking treatise on negotiation that totally changed the way practitioners thought about the field. Fisher and Ury's approach was basically to systematize problem solving so that negotiating parties could reach a mutually beneficial deal-the getting to \"Yes\" in the title. Their core assumption was that the emotional brain-that animalistic, unreliable, and irrational beast-could be overcome through a more rational, joint problem-solving mindset. Their system was easy to follow and seductive, with four basic tenets. One, separate the person-the emotion-from the problem; two, don't get wrapped up in the other side's position (\nthey're asking for) but instead focus on their interests (\nthey're asking for it) so that you can find what they really want; three, work cooperatively to generate win-win options; and, four, establish mutually agreed-upon standards for evaluating those possible solutions. It was a brilliant, rational, and profound synthesis of the most advanced game theory and legal thinking of the day. For years after that book came out, everybody-including the FBI and the NYPD-focused on a problem-solving approach to bargaining interactions. It just seemed so modern and\nHalfway across the United States, a pair of professors at the University of Chicago was looking at everything from economics to negotiation from a far different angle. They were the economist Amos Tversky and the psychologist Daniel Kahneman. Together, the two launched the field of behavioral economics-and Kahneman won a Nobel Prize-by showing that man is a very irrational beast. Feeling, they discovered, is a form of thinking. As you've seen, when business schools like Harvard's began teaching negotiation in the 1980s, the process was presented as a straightforward\neconomic analysis. It was a period when the world's top academic economists declared that we were all \"rational actors.\" And so it went in negotiation classes: assuming the other side was acting rationally and selfishly in trying to maximize its position, the goal was to figure out how to respond in various scenarios to maximize one's own value. This mentality baffled Kahneman, who from years in psychology knew that, in his words, \"[I]t is self-evident that people are neither fully rational nor completely selfish, and that their tastes are anything but stable.\"\nThrough decades of research with Tversky, Kahneman proved that humans all suffer from\nCognitive Bias\n, that is, unconscious-and irrational-brain processes that literally distort the way we see the world. Kahneman and Tversky discovered more than 150 of them. There's the\nFraming Effect\n, which demonstrates that people respond differently to the same choice depending on how it is framed (people place greater value on moving from 90 percent to 100 percent-high probability to certainty-than from 45 percent to 55 percent, even though they're both ten percentage points). Prospect Theory\nexplains why we take unwarranted risks in the face of uncertain losses. And the most famous is\nLoss Aversion\n, which shows how people are statistically more likely to act to avert a loss than to achieve an equal gain. Kahneman later codified his research in the 2011 bestseller\nThinking, Fast and Slow\nMan, he wrote, has two systems of thought: System 1, our animal mind, is fast, instinctive, and emotional; System 2 is slow, deliberative, and logical. And System 1 is far more influential. In fact, it guides and steers our rational thoughts. System 1's inchoate beliefs, feelings, and impressions are the main sources of the explicit beliefs and deliberate choices of System 2. They're the spring that feeds the river. We react emotionally (System 1) to a suggestion or question. Then that System 1 reaction informs and in effect creates the System 2 answer. Now think about that: under this model, if you know how to\naffect your counterpart's System 1 thinking, his inarticulate feelings, by how you frame and deliver your questions and statements, then you can guide his System 2 rationality and therefore modify his responses.",

That's what happened to Andy at Harvard: by asking, \"How am I supposed to do that?\" I influenced his System 1 emotional mind into accepting that his offer wasn't good enough; his System 2 then rationalized the situation so that it made sense to give me a better offer. If you believed Kahneman, conducting negotiations based on System 2 concepts without the tools to read, understand, and manipulate the System 1 emotional underpinning was like trying to make an omelet without first knowing how to crack an egg. THE FBI GETS EMOTIONAL\nAs the new hostage negotiating team at the FBI grew and gained more experience in problem-solving skills during the 1980s and '90s, it became clear that our system was lacking a crucial ingredient. At the time, we were deep into\nGetting to Yes\n. And as a negotiator, consultant, and teacher with decades of experience, I still agree with many of the powerful bargaining strategies in the book. When it was published, it provided groundbreaking ideas on cooperative problem solving and originated absolutely necessary concepts like entering negotiations with a BATNA: the Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement. It was genius. But after the fatally disastrous sieges of Randy Weaver's Ruby Ridge farm in Idaho in 1992 and David Koresh's Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, in 1993, there was no denying that most hostage negotiations were anything but rational problem-solving situations. I mean, have you ever tried to devise a mutually beneficial win-win solution with a guy who thinks he's the messiah? It was becoming glaringly obvious that\nGetting to Yes\ndidn't work with kidnappers. No matter how many agents read the book with highlighters in hand, it failed to improve how we as hostage negotiators approached deal making. There was clearly a breakdown between the book's brilliant theory and everyday law enforcement experience. Why was it that everyone had read this bestselling business book and endorsed it as one of the greatest negotiation texts ever written, and yet so few could actually follow it successfully? Were we morons? After Ruby Ridge and Waco, a lot of people were asking that question. U.S. deputy attorney general Philip B. Heymann, to be specific, wanted to know why our hostage negotiation techniques were so bad. In October 1993, he issued a report titled \"Lessons of Waco: Proposed Changes in Federal Law Enforcement,\"\nwhich summarized an expert panel's diagnosis of federal law enforcement's inability to handle complex hostage situations. As a result, in 1994 FBI director Louis Freeh announced the formation of the Critical Incident Response Group (CIRG), a blended division that would combine the Crises Negotiation, Crises Management, Behavioral Sciences, and Hostage Rescue teams and reinvent crisis negotiation. The only issue was, what techniques were we going to use? Around this time, two of the most decorated negotiators in FBI history, my colleague Fred Lanceley and my former boss Gary Noesner, were leading a hostage negotiation class in Oakland, California, when they asked their group of thirty-five experienced law enforcement officers a simple question: How many had dealt with a classic bargaining situation where problem solving was the best technique? Not one hand went up. Then they asked the complementary question: How many students had negotiated an incident in a dynamic, intense, uncertain environment where the hostage-taker was in emotional crisis and had no clear demands? Every hand went up. It was clear: if emotionally driven incidents, not rational bargaining interactions, constituted the bulk of what most police negotiators had to deal with, then our negotiating skills had to laser-focus on the animal, emotional, and irrational. From that moment onward, our emphasis would have to be not on training in quid pro quo bargaining and problem solving, but on education in the psychological skills needed in crisis intervention situations. Emotions and emotional intelligence would have to be central to effective negotiation, not things to be overcome. What were needed were simple psychological tactics and strategies that worked in the field to calm people down, establish rapport, gain trust, elicit the verbalization of needs, and persuade the other guy of our empathy. We needed something easy to teach, easy to learn, and easy to execute. These were cops and agents, after all, and they weren't interested in becoming academics or therapists. What they wanted was to change the behavior of the hostage-taker, whoever they were and whatever they wanted, to shift the emotional environment of the crisis just enough so that we could secure the safety of everyone involved. In the early years, the FBI experimented with both new and old therapeutic techniques developed by the counseling profession. These counseling skills were aimed at developing positive relationships with people by demonstrating an understanding of what they're going through and how they feel about it. It all starts with the universally applicable premise that people want to be understood and accepted. Listening is the cheapest, yet most effective concession we can make to get there. By listening intensely, a negotiator demonstrates empathy and shows a sincere desire to better understand what the other side is experiencing. Psychotherapy research shows that when individuals feel listened to, they tend to listen to themselves more carefully and to openly evaluate and clarify their own thoughts and feelings.",

The whole concept, which you'll learn as the centerpiece of this book, is called\nTactical Empathy\n. This is listening as a martial art, balancing the subtle behaviors of emotional intelligence and the assertive skills of influence, to gain access to the mind of another person. Contrary to popular opinion, listening is not a passive activity. It is the most active thing you can do. Once we started developing our new techniques, the negotiating world split into two currents: negotiation as learned at the country's top school continued down the established road of rational problem solving, while, ironically, we meatheads at the FBI began to train our agents in an unproven system based on psychology, counseling, and crisis intervention. While the Ivy League taught math and economics, we became experts in empathy. And our way worked. LIFE IS NEGOTIATION\nWhile you might be curious how FBI negotiators get some of the world's toughest bad guys to give up their hostages, you could be excused for wondering what hostage negotiation has to do with your life. Happily, very few people are ever forced to deal with Islamist terrorists who've kidnapped their loved ones. But allow me to let you in on a secret: Life is negotiation. The majority of the interactions we have at work and at home are negotiations that boil down to the expression of a simple, animalistic urge:\n\"I want you to free the hostages,\" is a very relevant one to this book, of course. But so is:\n\"I want you to accept that $1 million contract.\"\n\"I want to pay $20,000 for that car.\"\n\"I want you to give me a 10 percent raise.\"\n\"I want you to go to sleep at 9 p.m.\"\nNegotiation serves two distinct, vital life functions-information gathering and behavior influencing-and includes almost any interaction where each party wants something from the other side. Your career, your finances, your reputation, your love life, even the fate of your kids-at some point all of these hinge on your ability to negotiate. Negotiation as you'll learn it here is nothing more than communication with results. Getting what you want out of life is all about getting what you want from-and with-other people. Conflict between two parties is inevitable in all relationships. So it's useful-crucial, even-to know how to engage in that conflict to get what you want without inflicting damage. In this book, I draw on my more than two-decade career in the Federal Bureau of Investigation to distill the principles and practices I deployed in the field into an exciting new approach designed to help you disarm, redirect, and dismantle your counterpart in virtually any negotiation. And to do so in a relationship-affirming way. Yes, you'll learn how we negotiated the safe release of countless hostages. But you'll also learn how to use a deep understanding of\nhuman psychology to negotiate a lower car price, a bigger raise, and a child's bedtime. This book will teach you to reclaim control of the conversations that inform your life and career. The first step to achieving a mastery of daily negotiation is to get over your aversion to negotiating. You don't need to like it; you just need to understand that's how the world works. Negotiating does not mean browbeating or grinding someone down. It simply means playing the emotional game that human society is set up for. In this world, you get what you ask for; you just have to ask correctly. So claim your prerogative to ask for what you think is right. What this book is really about, then, is getting you to accept negotiation and in doing so learn how to get what you want in a psychologically aware way. You'll learn to use your emotions, instincts, and insights in any encounter to connect better with others, influence them, and achieve more. Effective negotiation is applied people smarts, a psychological edge in every domain of life: how to size someone up, how to influence their sizing up of you, and how to use that knowledge to get what you want. But beware: this is not another pop-psych book. It's a deep and thoughtful (and most of all, practical) take on leading psychological theory that distills lessons from a twenty-four-year career in the FBI and ten years teaching and consulting in the best business schools and corporations in the world. And it works for one simple reason: it was designed in and for the real world. It was not born in a classroom or a training hall, but built from years of experience that improved it until it reached near perfection. Remember, a hostage negotiator plays a unique role: he\nto win. Can he say to a bank robber, \"Okay, you've taken four hostages. Let's split the difference-give me two, and we'll call it a day?\"\nNo. A successful hostage negotiator has to get everything he asks for, without giving anything back of substance, and do so in a way that\nleaves the adversaries feeling as if they have a great relationship. His work is emotional intelligence on steroids. Those are the tools you'll learn here.",

His work is emotional intelligence on steroids. Those are the tools you'll learn here. Like a contractor building a house, this book is constructed from the ground up: first comes the big slabs of foundation, then the necessary load-bearing walls, the elegant but impermeable roof, and the lovely interior decorations. Each chapter expands on the previous one. First you'll learn the refined techniques of this approach to\nActive Listening\nand then you'll move on to specific tools, turns of phrase, the ins and outs of the final act-haggling-and, finally, how to discover the rarity that can help you achieve true negotiating greatness: the Black Swan. In Chapter 2, you'll learn how to avoid the assumptions that blind neophyte negotiators and replace them with\nActive Listening\ntechniques like\nLate-Night FM DJ Voice\n. You'll discover how to slow things down and make your counterpart feel safe enough to reveal themselves; to discern between wants (aspirations) and needs (the bare minimum for a deal); and to laser-focus on what the other party has to say. Chapter 3 will delve into\nTactical Empathy\n. You'll learn how to recognize your counterpart's perspective and then gain trust and understanding through\nthat is, by repeating that perspective back to them. You'll also learn how to defuse negative dynamics by bringing them into the open. Finally, I'll explain how to disarm your counterpart's complaints about you by speaking them aloud in an\nAccusation Audit\nNext, in Chapter 4, I'll examine ways to make your counterpart feel understood and positively affirmed in a negotiation in order to create\nan atmosphere of unconditional positive regard. Here, you'll learn why you should strive for \"That's right\" instead of \"Yes\" at every stage of a negotiation, and how to identify, rearticulate, and emotionally affirm your counterpart's worldview with\nParaphrasing\nChapter 5 teaches the flip side of\nGetting to Yes. You'll learn why it's vitally important to get to \"No\" because \"No\" starts the negotiation. You'll also discover how to step out of your ego and negotiate in your counterpart's world, the only way to achieve an agreement the other side will implement. Finally, you'll see how to engage your counterpart by acknowledging their right to choose, and you'll learn an email technique that ensures that you'll never be ignored again. In Chapter 6, you'll discover the art of bending reality. That is, I'll explain a variety of tools for framing a negotiation in such a way that your counterpart will unconsciously accept the limits you place on the discussion. You'll learn how to navigate deadlines to create urgency; employ the idea of fairness to nudge your counterpart; and anchor their emotions so that\naccepting your offer feels like a loss. After this, Chapter 7 is dedicated to that incredibly powerful tool I used at Harvard:\nCalibrated Questions\n, the queries that begin with \"How?\" or \"What?\" By eliminating \"Yes\" and \"No\" answers they force your counterpart to apply their mental energy to solving your problems. In Chapter 8 I demonstrate how to employ these\nCalibrated Questions\nto guard against failures in the implementation phase. \"Yes,\" as I always say, is nothing without \"How?\" You'll also discover the importance of nonverbal communication; how to use \"How\" questions to gently say \"No\"; how to get your counterparts to bid against themselves; and how to influence the deal killers when they're not at the table. At a certain point, every negotiation gets down to the brass tacks: that is, to old-school haggling. Chapter 9 offers a step-by-step process for effective bargaining, from how to prepare to how to dodge an\naggressive counterpart and how to go on the offensive. You'll learn the Ackerman system, the most effective process the FBI has for setting and making offers. Finally, Chapter 10 explains how to find and use those most rare of negotiation animals: the Black Swan. In every negotiation there are between three and five pieces of information that, were they to be uncovered, would change everything. The concept is an absolute game-changer; so much so, I've named my company The Black Swan Group. In this chapter, you'll learn how to recognize the markers that show the Black Swan's hidden nest, as well as simple tools for employing Black Swans to gain leverage over your counterpart and achieve truly amazing deals. Each chapter will start with a fast-paced story of a hostage negotiation, which will then be dissected with an eye to explaining what worked and what didn't. After I explain the theory and the tools, you'll read real-life case studies from me and others who've used these tools to prevail while negotiating a salary, purchasing a car, or working out nettlesome problems at home. When you finish this book, I will have succeeded if you've applied these crucial techniques to improve your career and life. I'm sure you will. Just remember, to successfully negotiate it is critical to prepare. Which is why in the Appendix you'll find an invaluable tool I use with all my students and clients called the Negotiation One Sheet: a concise primer of nearly all our tactics and strategies for you to think through and customize for whatever kind of deal you're looking to close. Most important to me is that you understand how urgent, essential, and even beautiful negotiation can be. When we embrace negotiating's transformative possibilities, we learn how to get what we want and how to move others to a better place. Negotiation is the heart of collaboration.",

      "text": "BE A MIRROR\nSeptember 30, 1993\nbrisk autumn morning, around eight thirty. Two masked bank robbers trigger an alarm as they storm into the Chase Manhattan Bank at Seventh Avenue and Carroll Street in Brooklyn. There are only two female tellers and a male security guard inside. The robbers crack the unarmed sixty-year-old security guard across the skull with a .357, drag him to the men's room, and lock him inside. One of the tellers gets the same pistol-whipping treatment. Then one of the robbers turns to the other teller, puts the barrel in her mouth, and pulls the trigger-click, goes the empty chamber. \"Next one is real,\" says the robber. \"Now open the vault.\"\nA bank robbery, with hostages. Happens all the time in the movies, but it had been almost twenty years since there'd been one of these standoffs in New York, the city with more hostage negotiation jobs than any other jurisdiction in the country. And this happened to be my very first feet-to-the-fire, in-your-face hostage job. I had been training for about a year and a half in hostage negotiations, but I hadn't had a chance to use my new skills. For me, 1993 had already been a very busy and incredible ride. Working on the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force, I had been the co-case agent in an investigation that thwarted a plot to set off bombs in the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels, the United Nations, and 26 Federal Plaza, the home of the FBI in New York City. We broke it up just as terrorists were mixing bombs in a safe house. The plotters were associated with an Egyptian cell that had ties to the \"Blind Sheikh,\" who later would be found guilty of masterminding the plot that we uncovered. You might think a bank robbery would be small potatoes after we busted up a terrorist plot, but by then I had already come to realize that negotiation would be my lifelong passion. I was eager to put my new skills to the test. And besides, there was nothing small about this situation. When we got the call, my colleague Charlie Beaudoin and I raced to the scene, bailed out of his black Crown Victoria, and made our way to the command post. The whole cavalry showed up for this one-NYPD, FBI, SWAT-all the muscle and savvy of law enforcement up against the knee-jerk desperation of a couple of bank robbers seemingly in over their heads. New York police, behind a wall of blue and white trucks and patrol cars, had set up across the street inside another bank. SWAT team members, peering through rifle scopes from the roofs of nearby brownstone buildings, had their weapons trained on the bank's front and rear doors. ASSUMPTIONS BLIND, HYPOTHESES GUIDE\nGood negotiators, going in, know they have to be ready for possible surprises; great negotiators aim to use their skills to reveal the surprises they are certain exist. Experience will have taught them that they are best served by holding multiple hypotheses-about the situation, about the counterpart's wants, about a whole array of variables-in their mind at the same time. Present and alert in the moment, they use all the new information that comes their way to test and winnow true hypotheses from false ones. In negotiation, each new psychological insight or additional piece of information revealed heralds a step forward and allows one to discard one hypothesis in favor of another. You should engage the process with a mindset of discovery. Your goal at the outset is to extract and observe as much information as possible. Which, by the way, is one of the reasons that really smart people often have trouble being negotiators-they're so smart they think they don't have anything to discover. Too often people find it easier just to stick with what they believe. Using what they've heard or their own biases, they often make assumptions about others even before meeting them. They even ignore their own perceptions to make them conform to foregone conclusions. These assumptions muck up our perceptual windows onto the world, showing us an unchanging-often flawed-version of the situation. Great negotiators are able to question the assumptions that the rest of the involved players accept on faith or in arrogance, and thus remain more emotionally open to all possibilities, and more intellectually agile to a fluid situation. Unfortunately, back in 1993, I was far from great. Everyone thought the crisis would be over quickly. The bank robbers had little choice but to surrender-or so we thought. We actually started the day with intelligence that the bank robbers wanted to surrender. Little did we know that was a ruse their ringleader planted to buy time. And throughout the day, he constantly referred to the influence the other four bank robbers exerted on him. I hadn't yet learned to be aware of a counterpart's overuse of personal pronouns-\nThe less important he makes himself, the more important he probably is (and vice versa). We would later find out there was only one other bank robber, and he had been tricked into the robbery. Actually, three robbers, if you counted the getaway driver, who got away before we even entered the scene. The \"lead\" hostage-taker was running his own \"counterintelligence operation,\" feeding us all kinds of misinformation. He wanted us to think he had a bunch of co-conspirators with him-from a number of different countries. He also wanted us to think that his partners were much more volatile and dangerous than he was. Looking back, of course, his game plan was clear-he wanted to confuse us as much as he could until he could figure a way out. He would constantly tell us that he wasn't in charge and that every decision was the responsibility of the other guys. He would indicate that he was scared-or, at least, a little tentative-when we asked him to pass along certain information.",

He would indicate that he was scared-or, at least, a little tentative-when we asked him to pass along certain information. And yet he always spoke with a voice of complete calm and absolute confidence. It was a reminder to my colleagues and me that until you know what you're dealing with, you don't know what you're dealing with. Though the call had come in about 8:30 a.m., by the time we arrived across the street from the bank and made contact it was probably about 10:30 a.m. The word when we came on the scene was that this was going to be cookie-cutter, by the book, short and sweet. Our commanders thought we'd be in and out of there in ten minutes, because the bad guys supposedly wanted to give themselves up. This would later become a problem, when negotiations stalled and Command became embarrassed, because they'd made the mistake of sharing this early optimism with the press, based on all the early misinformation. We arrived on the scene to take a surrender, but the situation went sideways almost immediately. Everything we\nwe knew was wrong. CALM THE SCHIZOPHRENIC\nOur Negotiation Operation Center (NOC) was set up in an office in a bank immediately across a narrow street from the Chase branch. We were way too close to the hostage site, so right away we were at a disadvantage. We were less than thirty yards from the crisis point, where ideally you want to have a little more of a buffer than that. You want to put some distance between you and whatever worst-case scenario might be waiting at the other end of the deal. When my partner and I arrived, I was immediately assigned to coach the police department negotiator on the phone. His name was Joe, and he was doing fine-but in these types of situations, nobody worked alone. We always worked in teams. The thinking behind this policy was that all these extra sets of ears would pick up extra information. In some standoffs, we had as many as five people on the line, analyzing the information as it came in, offering behind-the-scenes input and guidance to our man on the phone-and that's how we were set up here. We had Joe taking the lead on the phone, and another three or four of us were listening in, passing notes back and forth, trying to make sense of a confusing situation. One of us was trying to gauge the mood of the bad guy taking the lead on the other end, and another was listening in for clues or \"tells\" that might give us a better read on what we were facing, and so on. Students of mine balk at this notion, asking, \"Seriously, do you really need a whole team to . . . hear someone out?\" The fact that the FBI has come to that conclusion, I tell them, should be a wake-up call. It's really not that easy to listen well. We are easily distracted. We engage in selective listening, hearing only what we want to hear, our minds acting on a cognitive bias for consistency rather than truth. And that's just the start. Most people approach a negotiation so preoccupied by the arguments that support their position that they are unable to listen\nattentively. In one of the most cited research papers in psychology,\nGeorge A. Miller persuasively put forth the idea that we can process only about seven pieces of information in our conscious mind at any given moment. In other words, we are easily overwhelmed. For those people who view negotiation as a battle of arguments, it's the voices in their own head that are overwhelming them. When they're not talking, they're thinking about their arguments, and when they are talking, they're making their arguments. Often those on both sides of the table are doing the same thing, so you have what I call a state of schizophrenia: everyone just listening to the voice in their head (and not well, because they're doing seven or eight other things at the same time). It may look like there are only two people in a conversation, but really it's more like four people all talking at once. There's one powerful way to quiet the voice in your head and the voice in their head at the same time: treat two schizophrenics with just one pill. Instead of prioritizing your argument-in fact, instead of doing any thinking at all in the early goings about what you're going to say-make your sole and all-encompassing focus the other person and what they have to say. In that mode of true active listening-aided by the tactics you'll learn in the following chapters-you'll disarm your counterpart. You'll make them feel safe. The voice in their head will begin to quiet down. The goal is to identify what your counterparts actually need (monetarily, emotionally, or otherwise) and get them feeling safe enough to talk and talk and talk some more about what they want. The latter will help you discover the former. Wants are easy to talk about, representing the aspiration of getting our way, and sustaining any illusion of control we have as we begin to negotiate; needs imply survival, the very minimum required to make us act, and so make us vulnerable. But neither wants nor needs are where we start; it begins with listening, making it about the other people, validating their emotions, and creating enough trust and safety for a real conversation to begin.",

But neither wants nor needs are where we start; it begins with listening, making it about the other people, validating their emotions, and creating enough trust and safety for a real conversation to begin. We were far from that goal with the lead hostage-taker on the call. He kept putting up these weird smoke screens. He wouldn't give up his name, he tried to disguise his voice, he was always telling Joe he was being put on speaker so everyone around him in the bank could hear, and then he would abruptly announce that he was putting Joe on \"hold\" and hang up the phone. He was constantly asking about a van, saying he and his partners wanted us to arrange one for them so they could drive themselves and the hostages to the local precinct to surrender. That was where the surrender nonsense had come from-but, of course, this wasn't a surrender plan so much as it was an escape plan. In the back of his mind, this guy thought he could somehow leave the bank without being taken into custody, and now that his getaway driver had fled the scene he needed access to a vehicle. After it was all over, a couple of other details came clear. We weren't the only ones who had been lied to. Apparently, this lead bank robber hadn't told his partners they were going to rob a bank that morning. It turned out he was a cash courier who serviced the bank, and his partners were under the impression that they were going to burglarize the ATM. They didn't sign up for taking hostages, so we learned that this guy's co-conspirators were also hostages, in a way. They were caught up in a bad situation they didn't see coming-and, in the end, it was this \"disconnect\" among the hostage-takers that helped us to drive a wedge between them and put an end to the stalemate. SLOW. IT. DOWN. The leader wanted to make us think he and his partners were taking good care of his hostages, but in reality the security guard was out of the picture and the second bank teller had run to the bank basement to hide. Whenever Joe said he wanted to talk to the hostages, the hostage-taker would stall, and make it seem like there was this frenzy\nof activity going on inside the bank, going to ridiculous lengths to tell us how much time and energy he and his cohorts were spending on taking good care of the hostages. Very often, the leader would use this as a reason to put Joe on hold, or to end a call. He'd say, \"The girls need to go to the bathroom.\" Or, \"The girls want to call their families.\" Or, \"The girls want to get something to eat.\"\nJoe was doing a good job keeping this guy talking, but he was slightly limited by the negotiating approach that police departments were using at the time. The approach was half MSU-Making Shit Up-and half a sort of sales approach-basically trying to persuade, coerce, or manipulate in any way possible. The problem was, we were in too much of a hurry, driving too hard toward a quick solution; trying to be a problem solver, not a\npeople mover\nGoing too fast is one of the mistakes all negotiators are prone to making. If we're too much in a hurry, people can feel as if they're not being heard and we risk undermining the rapport and trust we've built. There's plenty of research that now validates the passage of time as one of the most important tools for a negotiator. When you slow the process down, you also calm it down. After all, if someone is talking, they're not shooting. We caught a break when the robbers started to make noise about food. Joe was going back and forth with them for a while on what they were going to have and how we were going to get it to them. It became a negotiation in and of itself. We got it all set up, prepared to send the food in on a kind of robot device, because that's what this guy was comfortable with, but then he did an about-face, said to forget about it. Said they'd found some food inside, so it was just one brick wall after another, one smoke screen after another. It would feel to us like we were making a little progress, then this guy would take an abrupt turn, or hang up on us, or change his mind. Meanwhile, our investigators used the time to run the registration of every one of the dozens of vehicles found nearby on the street, and\nmanaged to speak to the owners of every one of them except one-a car belonging to someone named Chris Watts. This became our one and only lead, at the time, and as our endless back-and-forth continued on the phone we sent a group of investigators to the address on Chris Watts's registration, where they found someone who knew Chris Watts and agreed to come down to the scene of the standoff to possibly identify him. We still didn't have a visual on the inside, so our eyewitness had to be more of an \"earwitness\"-and he was able to identify Chris Watts by his voice. We now knew more about our adversary than he\nwe knew, which put us at a momentary advantage.",

We still didn't have a visual on the inside, so our eyewitness had to be more of an \"earwitness\"-and he was able to identify Chris Watts by his voice. We now knew more about our adversary than he we knew, which put us at a momentary advantage. We were putting together all the puzzle pieces, but it didn't get us any closer to our endgame, which was to determine for sure who was inside the building, to ensure the health and well-being of the hostages, and to get them all out safely-the good guys\nthe bad guys. After five hours, we were stuck, so the lieutenant in charge asked me to take over. Joe was out; I was in. Basically, it was the only strategic play at our disposal that didn't involve an escalation in force. The man we now knew as Chris Watts had been in the habit of ending his calls abruptly, so my job was to find a way to keep him talking. I switched into my\nLate-Night, FM DJ Voice\n: deep, soft, slow, and reassuring. I had been instructed to confront Watts as soon as possible about his identity. I also came onto the phone with no warning, replacing Joe, against standard protocol. It was a shrewd move by the NYPD lieutenant to shake things up, but it easily could have backfired. This soothing voice was the key to easing the confrontation. Chris Watts heard my voice on the line and cut me off immediately-said, \"Hey, what happened to Joe?\"\nI said, \"Joe's gone. This is Chris. You're talking to me now.\"\nI didn't put it like a question. I made a downward-inflecting statement, in a downward-inflecting tone of voice. The best way to describe the late-night FM DJ's voice is as the voice of calm and reason. When deliberating on a negotiating strategy or approach, people tend to focus all their energies on what to say or do, but it's how we\n(our general demeanor and delivery) that is both the easiest thing to enact and the most immediately effective mode of influence. Our brains don't just process and understand the actions and words of others but their feelings and intentions too, the social meaning of their behavior and their emotions. On a mostly unconscious level, we can understand the minds of others not through any kind of thinking but through quite literally grasping what the other is feeling. Think of it as a kind of involuntary neurological telepathy-each of us in every given moment signaling to the world around us whether we are ready to play or fight, laugh or cry. When we radiate warmth and acceptance, conversations just seem to flow. When we enter a room with a level of comfort and enthusiasm, we attract people toward us. Smile at someone on the street, and as a reflex they'll smile back. Understanding that reflex and putting it into practice is critical to the success of just about every negotiating skill there is to learn. That's why your most powerful tool in any verbal communication is your voice. You can use your voice to intentionally reach into someone's brain and flip an emotional switch. Distrusting to trusting. Nervous to calm. In an instant, the switch will flip just like that with the right delivery. There are essentially three voice tones available to negotiators: the late-night FM DJ voice, the positive/playful voice, and the direct or assertive voice. Forget the assertive voice for now; except in very\nrare circumstances, using it is like slapping yourself in the face while you're trying to make progress. You're signaling dominance onto your counterpart, who will either aggressively, or passive-aggressively, push back against attempts to be controlled. Most of the time, you should be using the positive/playful voice. It's the voice of an easygoing, good-natured person. Your attitude is light and encouraging. The key here is to relax and smile while you're talking. A smile, even while talking on the phone, has an impact tonally that the other person will pick up on. The effect these voices have are cross-cultural and never lost in translation. On a vacation to Turkey with his girlfriend, one of our instructors at The Black Swan Group was befuddled-not to mention a little embarrassed-that his partner was repeatedly getting better deals in their backstreet haggling sessions at the spice markets in Istanbul. For the merchants in such markets throughout the Middle East, bargaining is an art form. Their emotional intelligence is finely honed, and they'll use hospitality and friendliness in a powerful way to draw you in and create reciprocity that ends in an exchange of money. But it works both ways, as our instructor discovered while observing his girlfriend in action: she approached each encounter as a fun game, so that no matter how aggressively she pushed, her smile and playful demeanor primed her merchant friends to settle on a successful outcome. When people are in a positive frame of mind, they think more quickly, and are more likely to collaborate and problem-solve (instead of fight and resist). It applies to the smile-er as much as to the smile-ee: a smile on your face, and in your voice, will increase your own mental agility. Playful wasn't the move with Chris Watts. The way the late-night FM DJ voice works is that, when you inflect your voice in a downward way, you put it out there that you've got it covered. Talking slowly and clearly you convey one idea:\nI'm in control\n. When you inflect in an\nupward way, you invite a response. Why? Because you've brought in a measure of uncertainty.",

Talking slowly and clearly you convey one idea: I'm in control . When you inflect in an upward way, you invite a response. Why? Because you've brought in a measure of uncertainty. You've made a statement sound like a question. You've left the door open for the other guy to take the lead, so I was careful here to be quiet, self-assured. It's the same voice I might use in a contract negotiation, when an item isn't up for discussion. If I see a work-for-hire clause, for example, I might say, \"We don't do work-for-hire.\" Just like that, plain, simple, and friendly. I don't offer up an alternative, because it would beg further discussion, so I just make a straightforward declaration. That's how I played it here. I said, \"Joe's gone. You're talking to me now.\"\nDone deal. You can be very direct and to the point as long as you create safety by a tone of voice that says I'm okay, you're okay, let's figure things out. The tide was turning. Chris Watts was rattled, but he had a few moves left in him. One of the bad guys went down to the basement and collected one of the female bank tellers. She'd disappeared into the bowels of the bank at some point, but Chris Watts and his accomplice hadn't chased after her because they knew she wasn't going anywhere. Now one of the bank robbers dragged her back upstairs and put her on the phone. She said, \"I'm okay.\" That's all. I said, \"Who is this?\"\nShe said, \"I'm okay.\"\nI wanted to keep her talking, so I asked her name-but then, just like that, she was gone. This was a brilliant move on Chris Watts's part. It was a threat, teasing us with the woman's voice, but subtly and indirectly. It was a way for the bad guy to let us know he was calling the shots on his end of the phone without directly escalating the situation. He'd given us a \"proof of life,\" confirming that he did indeed have hostages with him\nwho were in decent enough shape to talk on the phone, but stopped short of allowing us to gather any useful information. He'd managed to take back a measure of control. Chris Watts came back on the phone trying to act like nothing had happened. He was a little rattled, that's for sure, but now he was talking. \"We've identified every car on the street and talked to all the owners except one,\" I said to Watts. \"We've got a van out here, a blue and gray van. We've been able to get a handle on the owners of all of the vehicles except this one in particular. Do you know anything about it?\"\n\"The other vehicle's not out there because you guys chased my driver away . . .\" he blurted. \"We chased your driver away?\" I mirrored. \"Well, when he seen the police he cut.\"\n\"We don't know anything about this guy; is he the one who was driving the van?\" I asked. The mirroring continued between me and Watts, and he made a series of damaging admissions. He started vomiting information, as we now refer to it in my consulting business. He talked about an accomplice we had no knowledge of at the time. That exchange helped us nail the driver of the getaway car. Mirroring, also called isopraxism, is essentially imitation. It's another neurobehavior humans (and other animals) display in which we copy each other to comfort each other. It can be done with speech patterns, body language, vocabulary, tempo, and tone of voice. It's generally an unconscious behavior-we are rarely aware of it when it's happening-but it's a sign that people are bonding, in sync, and establishing the kind of rapport that leads to trust. It's a phenomenon (and now technique) that follows a very basic but profound biological principle: We fear what's different and are drawn to what's similar. As the saying goes, birds of a feather flock together. Mirroring, then, when practiced consciously, is the art of insinuating similarity. \"Trust me,\" a mirror signals to another's unconscious, \"You and I-we're alike.\"\nOnce you're attuned to the dynamic, you'll see it everywhere: couples walking on the street with their steps in perfect synchrony; friends in conversation at a park, both nodding their heads and crossing the legs at about the same time. These people are, in a word, connected. While mirroring is most often associated with forms of nonverbal communication, especially body language, as negotiators a \"mirror\" focuses on the words and nothing else. Not the body language. Not the accent. Not the tone or delivery. Just the words. It's almost laughably simple: for the FBI, a \"mirror\" is when you repeat the last three words (or the critical one to three words) of what someone has just said. Of the entirety of the FBI's hostage negotiation skill set, mirroring is the closest one gets to a Jedi mind trick. Simple, and yet uncannily effective. By repeating back what people say, you trigger this mirroring instinct and your counterpart will inevitably elaborate on what was just said and sustain the process of connecting. Psychologist Richard Wiseman created a study using waiters to identify what was the more effective method of creating a connection with strangers: mirroring or positive reinforcement. One group of waiters, using positive reinforcement, lavished praise and encouragement on patrons using words such as \"great,\" \"no problem,\" and \"sure\" in response to each order.",

One group of waiters, using positive reinforcement, lavished praise and encouragement on patrons using words such as \"great,\" \"no problem,\" and \"sure\" in response to each order. The other group of waiters mirrored their customers simply by repeating their orders back to them. The results were stunning: the average tip of the waiters who mirrored was 70 percent more than of those who used positive reinforcement. I decided it was time to hit him with his name-to let him know we were on to him. I said, \"There's a vehicle out here, and it's registered to a Chris Watts.\"\nHe said, \"Okay.\" Not letting anything on. I said, \"Is he there? Is this you? Are you Chris Watts?\"\nIt was a stupid question, on my part. A mistake. For a mirror to be effective, you've got to let it sit there and do its work. It needs a bit of silence. I stepped all over my mirror. As soon as I said it, I wanted to take it back. \"Are you Chris Watts?\"\nWhat the hell could this guy say to that? Of course, he replied, \"No.\"\nI'd made a bone-headed move and given Chris Watts a way to dodge this confrontation, but he was nevertheless rattled. Up until this moment, he'd thought he was anonymous. Whatever fantasy he had running through his head, there was a way out for him, a do-over button. Now he knew different. I composed myself, slowed it down a little, and this time shut my mouth after the mirror-I said, \"No? You said 'okay.'\"\nNow I had him, I thought. His voice went way up. He ended up blurting a few things out, vomiting more information, and became so flustered he stopped talking to me. Suddenly his accomplice, who we later learned was Bobby Goodwin, came onto the phone. We hadn't heard from this second hostage-taker, until now. We'd known all along that Chris Watts wasn't acting alone, but we hadn't gotten a good read on how many people he had working with him on this, and now here was his unwitting accomplice, thinking our original police department negotiator was still handling our end. We knew this because he kept calling me \"Joe,\" which told us he'd been in the loop early on, and somewhat less involved as the stalemate dragged on. At the very least, the disconnect told me these guys weren't exactly on the same page-but I didn't jump to correct him. Another thing: it sounded like this second guy was speaking through a towel, or a sweatshirt-like he was biting on some kind of fabric, even. Going to all these lengths to mask his voice, which meant he was clearly scared. He was nervous, jumpy as hell, anxious over how this standoff was going down. I tried to set him at ease-still with the downward-inflecting DJ voice. I said, \"Nobody's going anywhere.\" I said, \"Nobody's gonna get hurt.\"\nAfter about a minute and a half, the jumpiness seemed to disappear. The muffled voice, too. His voice came through much more clearly as he said, \"I trust you, Joe.\"\nThe more I kept this second guy on the phone, the more it became clear he was someplace he did not want to be. Bobby wanted out-and, of course, he wanted out without getting hurt. He was already in deep, but he didn't want it to get any deeper. He didn't start out that day planning to rob a bank, but it took hearing my calm voice on the other end of the phone for him to start to see a way out. The seventh-largest standing army in the world was at the ready outside the bank doors-that's the size and scope of the NYPD, in full force, and their guns were fixed on him and his partner. Obviously, Bobby was desperate to step out those doors unharmed. I didn't know where Bobby was, inside the bank. To this day, I don't know if he managed to step away from his partner, or if he was talking to me in plain sight of Chris Watts. I only know that I had his full attention, and that he was looking for a way to end the standoff-or, at least, to end his role in it. I learned later that in between phone calls Chris Watts was busy squirreling cash inside the bank walls. He was also burning piles of cash, in full view of the two female hostages. On the face of it, this was bizarre behavior, but to a guy like Chris Watts there was\na certain logic to it. Apparently, he'd gotten it in his head that he could burn, say, $50,000, and if $300,000 was reported missing bank officials wouldn't think to go looking for the other $250,000. It was an interesting deception-not exactly clever, but interesting. It showed a weird attention to detail. In his own mind at least, if Chris Watts managed to escape this box he'd made for himself, he could lie low for a while and come back at some future date for the money he'd stashed away-money that would no longer be on the bank's ledgers. What I liked about this second guy, Bobby, was that he didn't try to play any games with me on the phone. He was a straight shooter, so I was able to respond as a straight shooter in kind. The same way I'd get back whatever I put out, he was getting back whatever he was putting out, so I was with him on this.",

The same way I'd get back whatever I put out, he was getting back whatever he was putting out, so I was with him on this. Experience told me all I had to do was keep him talking and he'd come around. We'd find a way to get him out of that bank-with or without Chris Watts. Someone on my team handed me a note: \"Ask him if he wants to come out.\"\nI said, \"Do you want to come out first?\"\nI paused, remaining silent. \"I don't know how I'd do it,\" Bobby said finally. \"What's stopping you from doing it right now?\" I asked. \"How do I do that?\" he asked again. \"Tell you what. Meet me out front right now.\"\nThis was a breakthrough moment for us-but we still had to get Bobby out of there, and find a way to let him know that I'd be waiting for him on the other side of the door. I'd given him my word that I would be the one to take his surrender, and that he wouldn't get hurt, and now we had to make that happen-and very often it's this implementation phase that can be the most difficult. Our team scrambled to put a plan in place to bring this about. I started putting on bulletproof gear. We surveyed the scene, figuring I\ncould position myself behind one of the big trucks we'd parked out in front of the bank, to give me a measure of cover, just in case. Then we ran into one of those maddening situations where one hand didn't know what the other was doing. It turned out the bank door had been barricaded from the outside early on in the standoff-a precaution to ensure that none of the bank robbers could flee the scene. We all knew this, of course, on some level, but when the time came for Bobby to give himself up and walk out the door, it's like our brains went into sleep mode. No one on the SWAT team thought to remind anyone on the negotiating team of this one significant detail, so for a couple long beats Bobby couldn't get out, and I got a sick feeling in my stomach that whatever progress we'd just made with this guy would be for nothing. So there we were, scrambling to recover. Soon, two SWAT guys moved forward toward the entrance, with ballistic shields, guns drawn, to take the locks and the barricade off the door-and at this point they still didn't know what they were facing on the other side. It was a super-tense moment. There could have been a dozen guns on these two SWAT guys, but there was nothing for them to do but make their slow approach. Those guys were rock solid. They unlocked the door, backed away, and finally we were good to go. Bobby came out-his hands in the air. I'd walked him through a specific set of instructions on what to do when he came out the door, what to expect. A couple of SWAT guys patted him down. Bobby turned and looked and said, \"Where's Chris? Take me to Chris.\"\nFinally, they brought him around to me, and we were able to debrief him inside our makeshift command post. This was the first we learned that there was only one other hostage-taker inside-and this naturally set the commander off. I didn't learn this until later, but I could see why he would have been angry and embarrassed at this latest turn. All along, he'd been telling the media there were a bunch of bad guys\ninside-an international assemblage of bad guys, remember? But now that it turned out it was essentially a two-man operation, and one of the bad guys had wanted no part of it, the commander looked like he didn't have a handle on the situation. But like I said, we didn't know about the commander's reaction just yet. All we knew was that we'd just gotten all this new intel, which told us we were closer to achieving our desired outcome than we had just thought. This was a positive development, something to celebrate. With what we now knew, it was going to be a whole lot easier to negotiate our way through the rest of it, and yet this commander was angry. He didn't like that he'd been played, so he turned to one of the guys from NYPD's Technical Assistance Response Unit (TARU) and commanded them to get a camera inside the bank, a mic . . . Now that I was huddled with Bobby, the commander swapped me out in favor of another primary negotiator on the phone. The new negotiator played it the same way I had, a couple of hours earlier-said, \"This is Dominick. You're talking to me now.\"\nDominick Misino was a great hostage negotiator-in my view, one of the world's great closers, which was the term often used for the guy brought in to bang out the last details and secure the deal. He didn't get rattled and he was good at what he did. Matter-of-fact. Street smart. Dominick plowed ahead. And then, an amazing thing happened-a nearly disastrous amazing thing. As Chris Watts was talking to Dominick, he heard an electric tool of some kind burrowing its way through the wall behind him. It was one of our TARU guys, trying to get a bug planted inside-in precisely the wrong spot, at precisely the wrong time.",

As Chris Watts was talking to Dominick, he heard an electric tool of some kind burrowing its way through the wall behind him. It was one of our TARU guys, trying to get a bug planted inside-in precisely the wrong spot, at precisely the wrong time. Chris Watts was already rattled enough as it was, his partner giving himself up like that and leaving him to play out the siege on his own. And now, to hear our guys drilling through the wall, it just about set him off. He responded like a pit bull backed into a corner. He called Dominick a liar. Dominick was unflappable. He kept his cool as Chris Watts raged on the other end of the phone, and eventually Dominick's cool, calm demeanor brought the guy from a boil to a simmer. In retrospect, it was a fool move to try to get a bug inside the bank at this late stage-born out of frustration and panic. We'd gotten one of the hostage-takers out of the bank, but now we'd given back a measure of control. Startling the one remaining hostage-taker, who may or may not have been a loose cannon, was absolutely not a good idea. As Dominick went to work smoothing over the situation, Chris Watts switched things up on us. He said, \"What if I let a hostage go?\"\nThis came as if from nowhere. Dominick hadn't even thought to ask, but Chris Watts just offered up one of the tellers like it was no big deal-and to him, at this late stage in the standoff, I guess it wasn't. From his view, such a conciliatory move might buy him enough time to figure out a way to escape. Dominick remained calm, but seized on the opportunity. He said he wanted to talk to the hostage first, to make sure everything went okay, so Chris Watts tapped one of the women and put her on the phone. The woman had been paying attention, knew there'd been some sort of snafu when Bobby wanted to give himself up, so even though she was still completely terrified she had the presence of mind to ask about the door. I remember thinking this showed a lot of brass-to be terrified, held against your will, roughed up a bit, and to still have your wits about you. She said, \"Are you sure you have a key to the front door?\"\nDominick said, \"The front door's open.\"\nAnd it was. Ultimately, what happened was one of the women came out, unharmed, and an hour or so later the other woman followed, also unharmed. We were working on getting the bank guard out, but we couldn't be sure from the accounts of these bank tellers what kind of shape this guy might be in. We didn't even know if he was still alive. They hadn't seen him since first thing that morning. He could have had a heart attack and died-there was just no way to know. But Chris Watts had one last trick up his sleeve. He pulled a fast one on us and out of the blue, offered to come out. Maybe he thought he could catch us off guard one last time. What was strange about his sudden appearance was that he seemed to be looking about, surveying the scene, like he still thought he'd somehow elude capture. Right up until the moment the cops put the handcuffs on him, his gaze was darting back and forth, scanning for some kind of opportunity. The bright lights were on this guy, he was basically surrounded, but somewhere in the back of his scheming, racing mind he still thought he had a chance. It was a long, long day, but it went down in the books as a success. Nobody was hurt. The bad guys were in custody. And I emerged from the experience humbled by how much more there was to learn, but at the same time, awakened to and inspired by the elemental power of emotion, dialogue, and the FBI's evolving toolbox of applied psychological tactics to influence and persuade just about anyone in any situation. In the decades since my initiation into the world of high-stakes negotiations, I've been struck again and again by how valuable these seemingly simple approaches can be. The ability to get inside the head-and eventually under the skin-of your counterpart depends on these techniques and a willingness to change your approach, based on new evidence, along the way. As I've worked with executives and students to develop these skills, I always try to reinforce the message that being right isn't the key to a successful negotiation-having the right mindset is. HOW TO CONFRONT-AND GET YOUR WAY-WITHOUT CONFRONTATION\nI only half-jokingly refer to mirroring as magic or a Jedi mind trick because it gives you the ability to disagree without being disagreeable. To consider just how useful that can be, think of the average workplace: invariably there is still someone in a position of authority who arrived at that position through aggressive assertiveness, sometimes outright intimidation, with \"old school\" top-down, command-and-control assumptions that the boss is always right. And let's not delude ourselves: whatever the enlightened rules of the \"new school,\" in every environment (work or otherwise) you will always have to deal with forceful type A people who prefer consent to collaboration. If you take a pit bull approach with another pit bull, you generally end up with a messy scene and lots of bruised feelings and resentment. Luckily, there's another way without all the mess. It's just four simple steps:\nUse the late-night FM DJ voice. Start with \"I'm sorry . . .\"\nSilence.",

If you take a pit bull approach with another pit bull, you generally end up with a messy scene and lots of bruised feelings and resentment. Luckily, there's another way without all the mess. It's just four simple steps: Use the late-night FM DJ voice. Start with \"I'm sorry . . .\" Silence. At least four seconds, to let the mirror work its magic on your counterpart. One of my students experienced the effectiveness of this simple process at her workplace, where her impulsive boss was known for his \"drive-bys\": an infuriating practice by which the boss would suddenly swing by one's office or cubicle unannounced with an \"urgent,\" poorly thought out assignment that created a lot of unnecessary work. Past attempts at any kind of debate created immediate\npushback. \"There's a better way\" was always interpreted by this boss as \"the lazy way.\"\nSuch a drive-by occurred toward the end of a long consulting engagement, one that had generated literally thousands of documents. The boss, still skeptical of anything \"digital,\" wanted the security of paper copies. Popping his head into her office, the boss said, \"Let's make two copies of all the paperwork.\"\n\"I'm sorry, two copies?\" she mirrored in response, remembering not only the DJ voice, but to deliver the mirror in an inquisitive tone. The intention behind most mirrors should be \"Please, help me understand.\" Every time you mirror someone, they will reword what they've said. They will never say it exactly the same way they said it the first time. Ask someone, \"What do you mean by that?\" and you're likely to incite irritation or defensiveness. A mirror, however, will get you the clarity you want while signaling respect and concern for what the other person is saying. \"Yes,\" her boss responded, \"one for us and one for the customer.\"\n\"I'm sorry, so you are saying that the client is asking for a copy and we need a copy for internal use?\"\n\"Actually, I'll check with the client-they haven't asked for anything. But I definitely want a copy. That's just how I do business.\"\n\"Absolutely,\" she responded. \"Thanks for checking with the customer. Where would you like to store the in-house copy? There's no more space in the file room here.\"\n\"It's fine. You can store it anywhere,\" he said, slightly perturbed now. \"Anywhere?\" she mirrored again, with calm concern. When another person's tone of voice or body language is inconsistent with his words, a good mirror can be particularly useful. In this case, it caused her boss to take a nice, long pause-something he did not often do. My student sat silent. \"As a matter of fact, you can\nput them in my office,\" he said, with more composure than he'd had the whole conversation. \"I'll get the new assistant to print it for me after the project is done. For now, just create two digital backups.\"\nA day later her boss emailed and wrote simply, \"The two digital backups will be fine.\"\nNot long after, I received an ecstatic email from this student: \"I was shocked! I love mirrors! A week of work avoided!\"\nMirroring will make you feel awkward as heck when you first try it. That's the only hard part about it; the technique takes a little practice. Once you get the hang of it, though, it'll become a conversational Swiss Army knife valuable in just about every professional and social setting. KEY LESSONS\nThe language of negotiation is primarily a language of conversation and rapport: a way of quickly establishing relationships and getting people to talk and think together. Which is why when you think of the greatest negotiators of all time, I've got a surprise for you-think Oprah Winfrey. Her daily television show was a case study of a master practitioner at work: on a stage face-to-face with someone she has never met, in front of a crowded studio of hundreds, with millions more watching from home, and a task to persuade that person in front of her, sometimes against his or her own best interests, to talk and talk and keep talking, ultimately sharing with the world deep, dark secrets that they had held hostage in their own minds for a lifetime. Look closely at such an interaction after reading this chapter and suddenly you'll see a refined set of powerful skills: a conscious smile to ease the tension, use of subtle verbal and nonverbal language to signal empathy (and thus security), a certain downward inflection in the voice, embrace of specific kinds of questions and avoidance of\nothers-a whole array of previously hidden skills that will prove invaluable to you, once you've learned to use them. Here are some of the key lessons from this chapter to remember:\nA good negotiator prepares, going in, to be ready for possible surprises; a great negotiator aims to use her skills to reveal the surprises she is certain to find. Don't commit to assumptions; instead, view them as hypotheses and use the negotiation to test them rigorously. People who view negotiation as a battle of arguments become overwhelmed by the voices in their head. Negotiation is not an act of battle; it's a process of discovery. The goal is to uncover as much information as possible. To quiet the voices in your head, make your sole and all-encompassing focus the other person and what they have to say. Slow. It. Down. Going too fast is one of the mistakes all negotiators are prone to making. If we're too much in a hurry, people can feel as if they're not being heard. You risk undermining the rapport and trust you've built. Put a smile on your face.",

When people are in a positive frame of mind, they think more quickly, and are more likely to collaborate and problem-solve (instead of fight and resist). Positivity creates mental agility in both you and your counterpart. There are three voice tones available to negotiators:\nThe late-night FM DJ voice: Use selectively to make a point. Inflect your voice downward, keeping it calm and slow. When done properly, you create an aura of authority and trustworthiness without triggering defensiveness. The positive/playful voice: Should be your default voice. It's the voice of an easygoing, good-natured person. Your attitude is light and encouraging. The key here is to relax and smile while you're talking. The direct or assertive voice: Used rarely. Will cause problems and create pushback. Mirrors work magic. Repeat the last three words (or the critical one to three words) of what someone has just said. We fear what's different and are drawn to what's similar. Mirroring is the art of insinuating similarity, which facilitates bonding.

      "text": "DON'T FEEL THEIR PAIN, LABEL IT\nt was 1998 and I was standing in a narrow hallway outside an apartment on the twenty-seventh floor of a high-rise in Harlem. I was the head of the New York City FBI Crisis Negotiation Team, and that day I was the primary negotiator. The investigative squad had reported that at least three heavily armed fugitives were holed up inside. Several days earlier the fugitives had used automatic weapons in a shoot-out with a rival gang, so the New York City FBI SWAT team was arrayed behind me, and our snipers were on nearby rooftops with rifles trained on the apartment windows. In tense situations like this, the traditional negotiating advice is to keep a poker face. Don't get emotional. Until recently, most academics and researchers completely ignored the role of emotion in negotiation. Emotions were just an obstacle to a good outcome, they said. \"Separate the people from the problem\" was the common refrain. But think about that: How can you separate people from the problem when their emotions\nthe problem? Especially when they are scared people with guns. Emotions are one of the main things that derail communication. Once people get upset at one another, rational thinking goes out the window. That's why, instead of denying or ignoring emotions, good negotiators identify and influence them. They are able to precisely label emotions, those of others and especially their own. And once they label the emotions they talk about them without getting wound up. For them, emotion is a tool. Emotions aren't the obstacles, they are the means. The relationship between an emotionally intelligent negotiator and their counterpart is essentially therapeutic. It duplicates that of a psychotherapist with a patient. The psychotherapist pokes and prods to understand his patient's problems, and then turns the responses back onto the patient to get him to go deeper and change his behavior. That's exactly what good negotiators do. Getting to this level of emotional intelligence demands opening up your senses, talking less, and listening more. You can learn almost everything you need-and a lot more than other people would like you to know-simply by watching and listening, keeping your eyes peeled and your ears open, and your mouth shut. Think about the therapist's couch as you read the following sections. You'll see how a soothing voice, close listening, and a calm repetition of the words of your \"patient\" can get you a lot further than a cold, rational argument. It may sound touchy-feely, but if you can perceive the emotions of others, you have a chance to turn them to your advantage. The more you know about someone, the more power you have. TACTICAL EMPATHY\nWe had one big problem that day in Harlem: no telephone number to call into the apartment. So for six straight hours, relieved periodically by two FBI agents who were learning crisis negotiation, I spoke through the apartment door. I used my late-night FM DJ voice. I didn't give orders in my DJ voice, or ask what the fugitives wanted. Instead, I imagined myself in their place. \"It looks like you don't want to come out,\" I said repeatedly. \"It seems like you worry that if you open the door, we'll come in with guns blazing. It looks like you don't want to go back to jail.\"\nFor six hours, we got no response. The FBI coaches loved my DJ voice. But was it working? And then, when we were almost completely convinced that no one was inside, a sniper on an adjacent building radioed that he saw one of the curtains in the apartment move. The front door of the apartment slowly opened. A woman emerged with her hands in front of her. I continued talking. All three fugitives came out. None of them said a word until we had them in handcuffs. Then I asked them the question that was most nagging me: Why did they come out after six hours of radio silence? Why did they finally give in? All three gave me the same answer. \"We didn't want to get caught or get shot, but you calmed us down,\" they said. \"We finally believed you wouldn't go away, so we just came out.\"\nThere is nothing more frustrating or disruptive to any negotiation than to get the feeling you are talking to someone who isn't listening. Playing dumb is a valid negotiating technique, and \"I don't understand\" is a legitimate response. But ignoring the other party's position only builds up frustration and makes them less likely to do what you want. The opposite of that is tactical empathy. In my negotiating course, I tell my students that empathy is \"the ability to recognize the perspective of a counterpart, and the vocalization\nof that recognition.\" That's an academic way of saying that empathy is paying attention to another human being, asking what they are feeling, and making a commitment to understanding their world. Notice I didn't say anything about agreeing with the other person's values and beliefs or giving out hugs. That's sympathy. What I'm talking about is trying to understand a situation from another person's perspective. One step beyond that is tactical empathy. Tactical empathy is understanding the feelings and mindset of another in the moment and also hearing what is\nthose feelings so you increase your influence in all the moments that follow. It's bringing our attention to both the emotional obstacles and the potential pathways to getting an agreement done. It's emotional intelligence on steroids. As a cop in Kansas City, I was curious about how a select handful of veteran cops managed to talk angry, violent people out of fights or to get them to put down their knives and guns. When I asked how they did that, I rarely got more than a shrug. They couldn't articulate what they did. But now I know the answer is tactical empathy.",

When I asked how they did that, I rarely got more than a shrug. They couldn't articulate what they did. But now I know the answer is tactical empathy. They were able to think from another person's point of view while they were talking with that person and quickly assess what was driving them. Most of us enter verbal combat unlikely to persuade anyone of anything because we only know and care about our own goals and perspective. But the best officers are tuned in to the other party-their audience. They know that if they empathize, they can mold their audience by how they approach and talk to them. That's why, if a corrections officer approaches an inmate expecting him to resist, he often will. But if he approaches exuding calm, the inmate will be much more likely to be peaceful. It seems like wizardry, but it's not. It's just that when the officer has his audience clearly in mind, he can become who he needs to be to handle the situation. Empathy is a classic \"soft\" communication skill, but it has a physical basis. When we closely observe a person's face, gestures, and tone of voice, our brain begins to align with theirs in a process called neural resonance, and that lets us know more fully what they think and feel. In an fMRI brain-scan experiment,\nresearchers at Princeton University found that neural resonance disappears when people communicate poorly. The researchers could predict how well people were communicating by observing how much their brains were aligned. And they discovered that people who paid the most attention-good listeners-could actually anticipate what the speaker was about to say before he said it. If you want to increase your neural resonance skills, take a moment right now and practice. Turn your attention to someone who's talking near you, or watch a person being interviewed on TV. As they talk, imagine that you are that person. Visualize yourself in the position they describe and put in as much detail as you can, as if you were actually there. But be warned, a lot of classic deal makers will think your approach is softheaded and weak. Just ask former secretary of state Hillary Clinton. A few years ago during a speech at Georgetown University, Clinton advocated, \"showing respect, even for one's enemies. Trying to understand and, insofar as psychologically possible, empathize with their perspective and point of view.\"\nYou can predict what happened next. A gaggle of pundits and politicians pounced on her. They called her statement inane and na\u00efve, and even a sign she had embraced the Muslim Brotherhood. Some said that she had blown her chances at a presidential run. The problem with all of that hot air is that she was right. Politics aside, empathy is not about being nice or agreeing with the other side. It's about understanding them. Empathy helps us learn the\nposition the enemy is in, why their actions make sense (to them), and what might move them. As negotiators we use empathy because it works. Empathy is why the three fugitives came out after six hours of my late-night DJ voice. It's what helped me succeed at what Sun Tzu called \"the supreme art of war\": to subdue the enemy without fighting. Let's go back to the Harlem doorway for a minute. We didn't have a lot to go on, but if you've got three fugitives trapped in an apartment on the twenty-seventh floor of a building in Harlem, they don't have to say a word for you to know that they're worried about two things: getting killed, and going to jail. So for six straight hours in that sweltering apartment building hallway, the two FBI negotiating students and I took turns speaking. We rotated in order to avoid verbal stumbles and other errors caused by tiredness. And we stayed relentlessly on message, all three of us saying the same thing. Now, pay close attention to exactly what we said: \"It looks like you don't want to come out. It seems like you worry that if you open the door, we'll come in with guns blazing. It looks like you don't want to go back to jail.\"\nWe employed our tactical empathy by recognizing and then verbalizing the predictable emotions of the situation. We didn't just put ourselves in the fugitives' shoes. We spotted their feelings, turned them into words, and then very calmly and respectfully repeated their emotions back to them. In a negotiation, that's called labeling. Labeling is a way of validating someone's emotion by acknowledging it. Give someone's emotion a name and you show you identify\nwith how that person feels. It gets you close to someone without asking about external factors you know nothing about (\"How's your family?\"). Think of labeling as a shortcut to intimacy, a time-saving emotional hack. Labeling has a special advantage when your counterpart is tense. Exposing negative thoughts to daylight-\"It looks like you don't want to go back to jail\"-makes them seem less frightening. In one brain imaging study,\npsychology professor Matthew Lieberman of the University of California, Los Angeles, found that when people are shown photos of faces expressing strong emotion, the brain shows greater activity in the amygdala, the part that generates fear. But when they are asked to label the emotion, the activity moves to the areas that govern rational thinking. In other words, labeling an emotion-applying rational words to a fear-disrupts its raw intensity.",

But when they are asked to label the emotion, the activity moves to the areas that govern rational thinking. In other words, labeling an emotion-applying rational words to a fear-disrupts its raw intensity. Labeling is a simple, versatile skill that lets you reinforce a good aspect of the negotiation, or diffuse a negative one. But it has very specific rules about form and delivery. That makes it less like chatting than like a formal art such as Chinese calligraphy. For most people, it's one of the most awkward negotiating tools to use. Before they try it the first time, my students almost always tell me they expect their counterpart to jump up and shout, \"Don't you dare tell me how I feel!\"\nLet me let you in on a secret: people never even notice. The first step to labeling is detecting the other person's emotional state. Outside that door in Harlem we couldn't even see the fugitives, but most of the time you'll have a wealth of information from the other person's words, tone, and body language. We call that trinity \"words, music, and dance.\"\nThe trick to spotting feelings is to pay close attention to changes people undergo when they respond to external events. Most often, those events are your words. If you say, \"How is the family?\" and the corners of the other party's mouth turn down even when they say it's great, you might detect that all is not well; if their voice goes flat when a colleague is mentioned, there could be a problem between the two; and if your landlord unconsciously fidgets his feet when you mention the neighbors, it's pretty clear that he doesn't think much of them (we'll dig deeper into how to spot and use these cues in Chapter 9). Picking up on these tiny pieces of information is how psychics work. They size up their client's body language and ask him a few innocent questions. When they \"tell\" his future a few minutes later, they're really just saying what he wants to hear based on small details they've spotted. More than a few psychics would make good negotiators for that very reason. Once you've spotted an emotion you want to highlight, the next step is to label it aloud. Labels can be phrased as statements or questions. The only difference is whether you end the sentence with a downward or upward inflection. But no matter how they end, labels almost always begin with roughly the same words:\nIt seems like . . . It sounds like . . . It looks like . . . Notice we said \"It sounds like . . .\" and not \"I'm hearing that . . .\" That's because the word \"I\" gets people's guard up. When you say \"I,\" it says you're more interested in yourself than the other person, and it makes you take personal responsibility for the words that follow-and the offense they might cause. But when you phrase a label as a neutral statement of understanding, it encourages your counterpart to be responsive. They'll usually give a longer answer than just \"yes\" or \"no.\" And if they disagree with the label, that's okay. You can always step back and say, \"I didn't say that was what it was. I just said it seems like that.\"\nThe last rule of labeling is silence. Once you've thrown out a label,\nbe quiet and listen. We all have a tendency to expand on what we've said, to finish, \"It seems like you like the way that shirt looks,\" with a specific question like \"Where did you get it?\" But a label's power is that it invites the other person to reveal himself. If you'll trust me for a second, take a break now and try it out: Strike up a conversation and put a label on one of the other person's emotions-it doesn't matter if you're talking to the mailman or your ten-year-old daughter-and then go silent. Let the label do its work. NEUTRALIZE THE NEGATIVE, REINFORCE THE POSITIVE\nLabeling is a tactic, not a strategy, in the same way a spoon is a great tool for stirring soup but it's not a recipe. you use labeling will go a long way in determining your success. Deployed well, it's how we as negotiators identify and then slowly alter the inner voices of our counterpart's consciousness to something more collaborative and trusting. First, let's talk a little human psychology. In basic terms, people's emotions have two levels: the \"presenting\" behavior is the part above the surface you can see and hear; beneath, the \"underlying\" feeling is what motivates the behavior. Imagine a grandfather who's grumbly at a family holiday dinner: the presenting behavior is that he's cranky, but the underlying emotion is a sad sense of loneliness from his family never seeing him. What good negotiators do when labeling is address those underlying emotions. Labeling negatives diffuses them (or\nthem, in extreme cases); labeling positives reinforces them. We'll come back to the cranky grandfather in a moment. First, though, I want to talk a little bit about anger. As an emotion, anger is rarely productive-in you or the person you're negotiating with. It releases stress hormones and neurochemicals that disrupt your ability to properly evaluate and respond to\nsituations. And it blinds you to the fact that you're angry in the first place, which gives you a false sense of confidence. That's not to say that negative feelings should be ignored. That can be just as damaging. Instead, they should be teased out.",

That can be just as damaging. Instead, they should be teased out. Labeling is a helpful tactic in de-escalating angry confrontations, because it makes the person acknowledge their feelings rather than continuing to act out. Early on in my hostage negotiation career, I learned how important it was to go directly at negative dynamics in a fearless but deferential manner. It was to fix a situation I'd created myself. I'd angered the top FBI official in Canada when I entered the country without first alerting him (so he could notify the Department of State), a procedure known as \"country clearance.\"\nI knew I needed to call and assuage him to straighten out the situation, or I risked being expelled. Top guys like to feel on top. They don't want to be disrespected. All the more so when the office they run isn't a sexy assignment. \"Bless me, Father, for I have sinned,\" I said when he answered the phone. There was a long pause at the other end of the line. \"Who is this?\" he said. \"Bless me, Father, for I have sinned,\" I repeated. \"It's Chris Voss.\"\nAgain there was a long silence. \"Does your boss know you're here?\"\nI said he did, and crossed my fingers. At this point, the FBI official would have been completely within his rights to tell me to leave Canada immediately. But by mentioning the negative dynamic, I knew I'd diffused it as much as I could. I had a chance. \"All right, you've got country clearance,\" he finally said. \"I'll take care of the paperwork.\"\nTry this the next time you have to apologize for a bone-headed mistake. Go right at it. The fastest and most efficient means of establishing a quick working relationship is to acknowledge the negative and diffuse it. Whenever I was dealing with the family of a hostage, I started out by saying I knew they were scared. And when I make a mistake-something that happens a lot-I always acknowledge the other person's anger. I've found the phrase \"Look, I'm an asshole\" to be an amazingly effective way to make problems go away. That approach has never failed me. Let's go back to the cranky grandfather. He's grumpy because he never sees the family and he feels left out. So he's speaking up in his own dysfunctional way to get attention. How do you fix that? Instead of addressing his grumpy behavior, you acknowledge his sadness in a nonjudgmental way. You head him off before he can really get started. \"We don't see each other all that often,\" you could say. \"It seems like you feel like we don't pay any attention to you and you only see us once a year, so why should you make time for us?\"\nNotice how that acknowledges the situation and labels his sadness? Here you can pause briefly, letting him recognize and appreciate your attempts to understand what he's feeling, and then turn the situation around by offering a positive solution. \"For us this is a real treat. We want to hear what you have to talk about. We want to value this time with you because we feel left out of your life.\"\nResearch shows that the best way to deal with negativity is to observe it, without reaction and without judgment. Then consciously label each negative feeling and replace it with positive, compassionate, and solution-based thoughts. One of my Georgetown University students, a guy named TJ, who worked as an assistant controller at the Washington Redskins, put that lesson to work while he was taking my negotiations class. The economy was in the toilet at the time, and Redskins season ticket holders were leaving in droves to avoid the cost. Worse, the team had been\nthe year before, and off-field player problems were alienating the fans. The team's CFO was getting more worried-and cranky-by the day, and two weeks before the season was to start he walked by TJ's desk and slammed down a folder full of paper. \"Better yesterday than today,\" he said and walked away. Inside was a list of forty season ticket holders who hadn't paid their bills, a USB drive with a spreadsheet about each one's situation, and a script to use when calling them. TJ saw right away that the script was a disaster. It began by saying that his colleagues had been trying to call for months, and the account had been escalated to him. \"I wanted to inform you,\" it read, \"that in order to receive your tickets for the upcoming season opener against the New York Giants, you will need to pay your outstanding balance in full prior to September 10.\"\nIt was the stupidly aggressive, impersonal, tone-deaf style of communication that is the default for most business. It was all \"me, me, me\" from TJ, with no acknowledgment of the ticket holder's situation. No empathy. No connection. Just give me the money. Maybe I don't need to say it, but the script didn't work. TJ left messages; no one called back. A few weeks into the class, TJ rewrote the script. These weren't massive changes, and he didn't offer the fans any discounts. What he did was add subtle tweaks to make the call about the fans, their situation, and their love of the team.",

These weren't massive changes, and he didn't offer the fans any discounts. What he did was add subtle tweaks to make the call about the fans, their situation, and their love of the team. Now the team was \"YOUR Washington Redskins\" and the purpose of the call was to ensure that the team's most valuable fans-the\ndelinquent customers-would be there at the season opener. \"The home-field advantage created by you each and every Sunday at FedEx Field does not go unnoticed,\" TJ wrote. He then told them, \"In these difficult times, we understand our fans have been hit hard and we are here to work with you,\" and asked the ticket holders to call back to talk through their \"unique situation.\"\nThough superficially simple, the changes TJ made in the script had a deep emotional resonance with the delinquent ticket holders. It mentioned their debt to the team but also acknowledged the team's debt to them, and by labeling the tough economic times, and the stress they were causing, it diffused the biggest negative dynamic-their delinquency-and turned the issue into something solvable. The simple changes masked a complex understanding of empathy on TJ's side. With the new script, TJ was able to set up payment plans with all the ticket holders before the Giants game. And the CFO's next visit? Well, it was far less terse. CLEAR THE ROAD BEFORE ADVERTISING THE DESTINATION\nRemember the amygdala, the part of the brain that generates fear in reaction to threats? Well, the faster we can interrupt the amygdala's reaction to real or imaginary threats, the faster we can clear the road of obstacles, and the quicker we can generate feelings of safety, well-being, and trust. We do that by labeling the fears. These labels are so powerful because they bathe the fears in sunlight, bleaching them of their power and showing our counterpart that we understand. Think back to that Harlem landing: I didn't say, \"It seems like you want us to let you go.\" We could all agree on that. But that wouldn't have diffused the real fear in the apartment, or shown that I empathized with the grim complexity of their situation. That's why I went\nright at the amygdala and said, \"It seems like you don't want to go back to jail.\"\nOnce they've been labeled and brought into the open, the negative reactions in your counterpart's amygdala will begin to soften. I promise it will shock you how suddenly his language turns from worry to optimism. Empathy is a powerful mood enhancer. The road is not always cleared so easily, so don't be demoralized if this process seems to go slowly. The Harlem high-rise negotiation took six hours. Many of us wear fears upon fears, like layers against the cold, so getting to safety takes time. That was the experience of another one of my students, a fund-raiser for the Girl Scouts, who backed into naming her counterpart's fears almost accidentally. We're not talking about someone who sold Girl Scout cookies: my student was an experienced fund-raiser who regularly got donors to pony up $1,000 to $25,000 a check. Over the years, she'd developed a very successful system to get her \"clients,\" usually wealthy women, to open their checkbook. She'd invite a potential donor to her office, serve a few Girl Scouts cookies, walk her through an album of heartwarming snapshots and handwritten letters from projects that matched the woman's profile, and then collect a check when the donor's eyes lit up. It was almost easy. One day, though, she met the immovable donor. Once the woman sat down in her office, my student began to throw out the projects her research had said would fit. But the woman shook her head at one project after another. My student found herself growing perplexed at the difficult donor who had no interest in donating. But she held her emotion in check and reached back to a lesson from my recent class on labeling. \"I'm sensing some hesitation with these projects,\" she said in what she hoped was a level voice. As if she'd been uncorked, the woman exclaimed: \"I want my gift to directly support programming for Girl Scouts and not anything else.\"\nThis helped focus the conversation, but as my student put forth project after project that seemed to fulfill the donor's criteria, all she got was still rejection. Sensing the potential donor's growing frustration, and wanting to end on a positive note so that they might be able to meet again, my student used another label. \"It seems that you are really passionate about this gift and want to find the right project reflecting the opportunities and life-changing experiences the Girl Scouts gave you.\"\nAnd with that, this \"difficult\" woman signed a check without even picking a specific project. \"You understand me,\" she said as she got up to leave. \"I trust you'll find the right project.\"\nFear of her money being misappropriated was the presenting dynamic that the first label uncovered. But the second label uncovered the underlying dynamic-her very presence in the office was driven by very specific memories of being a little Girl Scout and how it changed her life. The obstacle here wasn't finding the right match for the woman. It wasn't that she was this highly finicky, hard-to-please donor. The real obstacle was that this woman needed to feel that she was understood, that the person handling her money knew why she was in that office and understood the memories that were driving her actions.",

The real obstacle was that this woman needed to feel that she was understood, that the person handling her money knew why she was in that office and understood the memories that were driving her actions. That's why labels are so powerful and so potentially transformative to the state of any conversation. By digging beneath what seems like a mountain of quibbles, details, and logistics, labels help to uncover and identify the primary emotion driving almost all of your counterpart's behavior, the emotion that, once acknowledged, seems to miraculously solve everything else. DO AN ACCUSATION AUDIT\nOn the first day of negotiating class each semester, I march the group through an introductory exercise called \"sixty seconds or she dies.\" I play a hostage-taker and a student has to convince me to release my hostage within a minute. It's an icebreaker that shows me the level of my students, and it reveals to them how much they need to learn. (Here's a little secret: the hostage never gets out.)\nSometimes students jump right in, but finding takers is usually hard because it means coming to the front of the class and competing with the guy who holds all the cards. If I just ask for a volunteer, my students sit on their hands and look away. You've been there. You can almost feel your back muscles tense as you think, Oh please, don't call on me. So I don't ask. Instead, I say, \"In case you're worried about volunteering to role-play with me in front of the class, I want to tell you in advance . . . it's going to be horrible.\"\nAfter the laughter dies down, I then say, \"And those of you who do volunteer will probably get more out of this than anyone else.\"\nI always end up with more volunteers than I need. Now, look at what I did: I prefaced the conversation by labeling my audience's fears; how much worse can something be than \"horrible\"? I defuse them and wait, letting it sink in and thereby making the unreasonable seem less forbidding. All of us have intuitively done something close to this thousands of times. You'll start a criticism of a friend by saying, \"I don't want this to sound harsh . . .\" hoping that whatever comes next will be softened. Or you'll say, \"I don't want to seem like an asshole . . .\" hoping your counterpart will tell you a few sentences later that you're not that bad. The small but critical mistake this commits is denying the negative. That actually gives it credence. In court, defense lawyers do this properly by mentioning everything their client is accused of, and all the weaknesses of their case, in the opening statement. They call this technique \"taking the sting out.\"\nWhat I want to do here is turn this into a process that, applied systematically, you can use to disarm your counterpart while negotiating everything from your son's bedtime to large business contracts. The first step of doing so is listing every terrible thing your counterpart\nsay about you, in what I call an accusation audit. This idea of an accusation audit is really, really hard for people to get their minds around. The first time I tell my students about it, they say, \"Oh my God. We can't do that.\" It seems both artificial and self-loathing. It seems like it would make things worse. But then I remind them that it's exactly what I did the first day of class when I labeled their fears of the hostage game in advance. And they all admit that none of them knew. As an example, I'm going to use the experience of one of my students, Anna, because I couldn't be more proud at how she turned what she learned in my class into $1 million. At the time, Anna was representing a major government contractor. Her firm had won a competition for a sizable government deal by partnering with a smaller company, let's call it ABC Corp., whose CEO had a close relationship with the government client representative. Problems started right after they won the contract, though. Because ABC's relationship had been instrumental in winning the deal, ABC felt that it was owed a piece of the pie whether it fulfilled its part of the contract or not. And so, while the contract paid them for the work of nine people, they continually cut back support. As Anna's company had to perform ABC's work, the relationship between ABC and Anna's company fragmented into vituperative emails and bitter complaining. Facing an already low profit margin, Anna's company was forced into tough negotiations to get ABC to take a cut to 5.5 people. The negotiations\nleft a bitter aftertaste on both sides. The vituperative emails stopped, but then again\nemails stopped. And no communication is always a bad sign. A few months after those painful talks, the client demanded a major rethink on the project and Anna's firm was faced with losing serious money if it didn't get ABC to agree to further cuts. Because ABC wasn't living up to its side of the bargain, Anna's firm would have had strong contractual grounds to cut out ABC altogether. But that would have damaged Anna's firm's reputation with a very important customer, and could have led to litigation from ABC. Faced with this scenario, Anna set up a meeting with ABC where she and her partners planned to inform ABC that its pay was being cut to three people.

      "text": "serious money if it didn't get ABC to agree to further cuts. Because ABC wasn't living up to its side of the bargain, Anna's firm would have had strong contractual grounds to cut out ABC altogether. But that would have damaged Anna's firm's reputation with a very important customer, and could have led to litigation from ABC. Faced with this scenario, Anna set up a meeting with ABC where she and her partners planned to inform ABC that its pay was being cut to three people. It was a touchy situation, as ABC was already unhappy about the first cut. Even though she was normally an aggressive and confident negotiator, worries about the negotiations ruined Anna's sleep for weeks. She needed to extract concessions while improving the relationship at the same time. No easy task, right? To prepare, the first thing Anna did was sit down with her negotiating partner, Mark, and list every negative charge that ABC could level at them. The relationship had gone sour long before, so the list was huge. But the biggest possible accusations were easy to spot:\n\"You are the typical prime contractor trying to force out the small guy.\"\n\"You promised us we would have all this work and you reneged on your promise.\"\n\"You could have told us about this issue weeks ago to help us prepare.\"\nAnna and Mark then took turns role-playing the two sides, with one playing ABC and the other disarming these accusations with anticipatory labels. \"You're going to think we are a big, bad prime contractor when we are done,\" Anna practiced saying slowly and naturally. \"It seems you feel this work was promised to you from the\nbeginning,\" Mark said. They trained in front of an observer, honing their pacing; deciding at what point they would label each fear; and planning when to include meaningful pauses. It was theater. When the day of the meeting arrived, Anna opened by acknowledging ABC's biggest gripes. \"We understand that we brought you on board with the shared goal of having you lead this work,\" she said. \"You may feel like we have treated you unfairly, and that we changed the deal significantly since then. We acknowledge that you believe you were promised this work.\"\nThis received an emphatic nod from the ABC representatives, so Anna continued by outlining the situation in a way that encouraged the ABC reps to see the firms as teammates, peppering her statements with open-ended questions that showed she was listening: \"What else is there you feel is important to add to this?\"\nBy labeling the fears and asking for input, Anna was able to elicit an important fact about ABC's fears, namely that ABC was expecting this to be a high-profit contract because it thought Anna's firm was doing quite well from the deal. This provided an entry point for Mark, who explained that the client's new demands had turned his firm's profits into losses, meaning that he and Anna needed to cut ABC's pay further, to three people. Angela, one of ABC's representatives, gasped. \"It sounds like you think we are the big, bad prime contractor trying to push out the small business,\" Anna said, heading off the accusation before it could be made. \"No, no, we don't think that,\" Angela said, conditioned by the acknowledgment to look for common ground. With the negatives labeled and the worst accusations laid bare, Anna and Mark were able to turn the conversation to the contract. Watch what they do closely, as it's brilliant: they acknowledge ABC's situation while simultaneously shifting the onus of offering a solution to the smaller company. \"It sounds like you have a great handle on how the government contract\nwork,\" Anna said, labeling Angela's expertise. \"Yes-but I know that's not how it always goes,\" Angela answered, proud to have her experience acknowledged. Anna then asked Angela how she would amend the contract so that everyone made some money, which pushed Angela to admit that she saw no way to do so without cutting ABC's worker count. Several weeks later, the contract was tweaked to cut ABC's payout, which brought Anna's company $1 million that put the contract into the black. But it was Angela's reaction at the end of the meeting that most surprised Anna. After Anna had acknowledged that she had given Angela some bad news and that she understood how angry she must feel, Angela said:\n\"This is not a good situation but we appreciate the fact that you are acknowledging what happened, and we don't feel like you are mistreating us. And you are not the 'Big Bad Prime.'\"\nAnna's reaction to how this turned out? \"Holy crap, this stuff actually works!\"\nShe's right. As you just saw, the beauty of going right after negativity is that it brings us to a safe zone of empathy. Every one of us has an inherent, human need to be understood, to connect with the person across the table. That explains why, after Anna labeled Angela's fears, Angela's first instinct was to add nuance and detail to those fears. And that detail gave Anna the power to accomplish what she wanted from the negotiation. GET A SEAT-AND AN UPGRADE-ON A SOLD-OUT FLIGHT\nUp to this point, we've been building each skill as if they were musical instruments: first, try the saxophone mirror; now here's the bass label; and finally, why don't you blow a note on the French horn of tactical\nsilence. But in a real negotiation the band all plays together. So you've got to learn how to conduct. Keeping all the instruments playing is really awkward for most people. It seems to go by in such a rush.

So what I'm going to do here is play a song at slow speed so you can hear each instrument note by note. I promise you'll quickly see how the skills you have been building play off one another, rising, riffing, falling, and pausing in perfect harmony. Here is the situation (the song, if you will): My student Ryan B. was flying from Baltimore to Austin to sign a large computer-consulting contract. For six months, the client representative had gone back and forth on whether he wanted the services, but a major system collapse put the representative in a tight spot with his CEO. To shift the blame, he called Ryan with his CEO on the line and very aggressively demanded to know why it was taking Ryan so long to come ink the contract. If Ryan was not there by Friday morning, he said, the deal was off. Ryan bought a ticket for the next morning, Thursday, but a freak lightning storm whipped up in Baltimore, closing the airport for five hours. It became painfully clear that Ryan wasn't going to make his original connection to Austin from Dallas. Worse, when he called American Airlines just before departing, he found that his connection had been automatically rebooked to 3 p.m. the next day, putting the contract in jeopardy. When Ryan finally got to Dallas at 8 p.m., he ran to the gate where the day's final American Airlines flight to Austin was less than thirty minutes from takeoff. His goal was to get on that flight or, at worst, get an earlier flight the next day. In front of him at the gate, a very aggressive couple was yelling at the gate agent, who was barely looking at them as she tapped on the computer in front of her; she was clearly making every effort not to scream back. After she'd said, \"There's nothing I can do,\" five times, the angry couple finally gave up and left. To start, watch how Ryan turns that heated exchange to his advantage. Following on the heels of an argument is a great position for a negotiator, because your counterpart is desperate for an empathetic connection. Smile, and you're already an improvement. \"Hi, Wendy, I'm Ryan. It seems like they were pretty upset.\"\nThis labels the negative and establishes a rapport based on empathy. This in turn encourages Wendy to elaborate on her situation, words Ryan then mirrors to invite her to go further. \"Yeah. They missed their connection. We've had a fair amount of delays because of the weather.\"\n\"The weather?\"\nAfter Wendy explains how the delays in the Northeast had rippled through the system, Ryan again labels the negative and then mirrors her answer to encourage her to delve further. \"It seems like it's been a hectic day.\"\n\"There've been a lot of 'irate consumers,' you know? I mean, I get it, even though I don't like to be yelled at. A lot of people are trying to get to Austin for the big game.\"\n\"The big game?\"\n\"UT is playing Ole Miss football and every flight into Austin has been booked solid.\"\n\"Booked solid?\"\nNow let's pause. Up to this point, Ryan has been using labels and mirrors to build a relationship with Wendy. To her it must seem like idle chatter, though, because he hasn't asked for anything. Unlike the angry couple, Ryan is acknowledging her situation. His words ping-pong between \"What's that?\" and \"I hear you,\" both of which invite her to elaborate. Now that the empathy has been built, she lets slip a piece of information he can use. \"Yeah, all through the weekend. Though who knows how many people will make the flights. The weather's probably going to reroute a lot of people through a lot of different places.\"\nHere's where Ryan finally swoops in with an ask. But notice how he acts: not assertive or coldly logical, but with empathy and labeling that acknowledges her situation and tacitly puts them in the same boat. \"Well, it seems like you've been handling the rough day pretty well,\" he says. \"I was also affected by the weather delays and missed my connecting flight. It seems like this flight is likely booked solid, but with what you said, maybe someone affected by the weather might miss this connection. Is there any possibility a seat will be open?\"\nListen to that riff: Label, tactical empathy, label. And only then a request. At this point, Wendy says nothing and begins typing on her computer. Ryan, who's eager not to talk himself out of a possible deal, engages in some silence. After thirty seconds, Wendy prints a boarding pass and hands it to Ryan, explaining that there were a few seats that were supposed to be filled by people who would now arrive much later than the flight's departure. To make Ryan's success even better, she puts him in Economy Plus seating. All that in under two minutes! The next time you find yourself following an angry customer at a corner store or airplane line, take a moment and practice labels and mirrors on the service person. I promise they won't scream, \"Don't try to control me!\" and burst into flames-and you might walk away with a little more than you expected.

KEY LESSONS As you try to insert the tools of tactical empathy into your daily life, I encourage you to think of them as extensions of natural human interactions and not artificial conversational tics. In any interaction, it pleases us to feel that the other side is listening and acknowledging our situation. Whether you are negotiating\na business deal or simply chatting to the person at the supermarket butcher counter, creating an empathetic relationship and encouraging your counterpart to expand on their situation is the basis of healthy human interaction. These tools, then, are nothing less than emotional best practices that help you cure the pervasive ineptitude that marks our most critical conversations in life. They will help you connect and create more meaningful and warm relationships. That they might help you extract what you want is a bonus; human connection is the first goal. With that in mind, I encourage you to take the risk of sprinkling these in every conversation you have. I promise you that they will feel awkward and artificial at first, but keep at it. Learning to walk felt awfully strange, too. As you internalize these techniques, turning the artifice of tactical empathy into a habit and then into an integral part of your personality, keep in mind these lessons from the chapter you've just read:\nImagine yourself in your counterpart's situation. The beauty of empathy is that it doesn't demand that you agree with the other person's ideas (you may well find them crazy). But by acknowledging the other person's situation, you immediately convey that you are listening. And once they know that you are listening, they may tell you something that you can use. The reasons why a counterpart will\nmake an agreement with you are often more powerful than why they\nmake a deal, so focus first on clearing the barriers to agreement. Denying barriers or negative influences gives them credence; get them into the open. Pause. After you label a barrier or mirror a statement, let it sink in. Don't worry, the other party will fill the silence. Label your counterpart's fears to diffuse their power. We all want to talk about the happy stuff, but remember, the faster you interrupt action in your counterpart's amygdala, the part of the brain that generates fear, the faster you can generate feelings of safety, well-being, and trust. List the worst things that the other party could say about you and say them before the other person can. Performing an accusation audit in advance prepares you to head off negative dynamics before they take root. And because these accusations often sound exaggerated when said aloud, speaking them will encourage the other person to claim that quite the opposite is true. Remember you're dealing with a person who wants to be appreciated and understood. So use labels to reinforce and encourage positive perceptions and dynamics.",

      "text": "BEWARE \"YES\"-MASTER \"NO\"\net me paint a scenario we've all experienced: You're at home, just before dinner, and the phone rings. It is, no surprise, a telemarketer. He wants to sell you magazine subscriptions, water filters, frozen Argentine beef-to be honest, it doesn't matter, as the script is always the same. After butchering your name, and engaging in some disingenuous pleasantries, he launches into his pitch. The hard sell that comes next is a scripted flowchart designed to cut off your escape routes as it funnels you down a path with no exit but \"Yes.\" \"Do you enjoy a nice glass of water from time to time.\" \"Well, yes, but . . .\" \"Me, too. And like me I bet you like crisp, clean water with no chemical aftertaste, like Mother Nature made it.\" \"Well, yes, but . . .\"\nWho is this guy with a fake smile in his voice, you wonder, who thinks he can trick you into buying something you don't want? You feel your muscles tighten, your voice go defensive, and your heart rate accelerate. You feel like his prey, and you are! The last thing you want to do is say \"Yes,\" even when it's the only way to answer, \"Do you drink water?\" Compromise and concession, even to the truth, feels like defeat. And \"No,\" well, \"No\" feels like\nsalvation, like an oasis. You're tempted to use \"No\" when it's blatantly untrue, just to hear its sweet sound. \"\nneed water, carbon filtered or otherwise. I'm a camel! Now let's think about this selling technique. It's designed to get to \"Yes\" at all costs, as if \"No\" were death. And for many of us it is. We have all these negative connotations with \"No.\" We talk about the rejection of \"No,\" about the fear of hearing it. \"No\" is the ultimate negative word. But at the end of the day, \"Yes\" is often a meaningless answer that hides deeper objections (and \"Maybe\" is even worse). Pushing hard for \"Yes\" doesn't get a negotiator any closer to a win; it just angers the other side. So if \"Yes\" can be so damn uncomfortable, and \"No\" such a relief, why have we fetishized one and demonized the other? We have it backward. For good negotiators, \"No\" is pure gold. That negative provides a great opportunity for you and the other party to clarify what you really want by eliminating what you don't want. \"No\" is a safe choice that maintains the status quo; it provides a temporary oasis of control. At some point in their development, all negotiators have to come to grips with \"No.\" When you come to realize the real psychological dynamic behind it, you'll love the word. It's not just that you lose your fear of it, but that you come to learn what it does for you and how you can build deals out of it. \"Yes\" and \"Maybe\" are often worthless. But \"No\" always alters the conversation. \"NO\" STARTS THE NEGOTIATION\nMy fascination with \"No\" in all its beautiful nuance began with a conversation I had a few months before my negotiation career began. I started my career with the Bureau as a member of the FBI SWAT team in the Pittsburgh Division but after nearly two years I was transferred to New York, where the FBI attached me to the Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF). It was an amazing post: We spent our days and nights tracking suspected terrorists, investigating their cells, and assessing whether or how they might strike. We were untying knots of human anger in the midst of America's biggest city, making life-and-death decisions on who was dangerous and who was just blowing hot air. The work fascinated me. Ever since my first days with the Bureau, I had been obsessed with crisis response. The immediacy of the task enthralled me. The stakes were high. Lives hung in the balance. The emotional terrain was complex, changing, and often conflicting. To successfully gain a hostage's safe release, a negotiator had to penetrate the hostage-taker's motives, state of mind, intelligence, and emotional strengths and weaknesses. The negotiator played the role of bully, conciliator, enforcer, savior, confessor, instigator, and peacemaker-and that's just a few of the parts. I thought I was cut out for every one of them. A few weeks after I got to Manhattan, I showed up at the desk of Amy Bonderow, who ran the FBI's Crisis Negotiation Team in New York. I didn't know beans about negotiating, so I went for the direct approach. \"I want be a hostage negotiator,\" I said. \"Everyone does-got any training?\" she asked. \"No,\" I said. \"Any credentials?\"\n\"Nope.\" I answered. \"Any experience?\" she asked. \"No,\" I answered. \"Do you have a degree in psychology, sociology,\nat all related to negotiation?\"\n\"Looks like you answered your own question,\" she said. \"No. Now go away.\"\n\"Go away?\" I protested. \"Really?\"\n\"Yep. As in, 'Leave me alone.' Everybody wants to be a hostage negotiator, and you have no r\u00e9sum\u00e9, experience, or skills. So what would you say in my position? You got it: 'No.'\"\nI paused in front of her, thinking, This is not how my negotiating career ends. I had stared down terrorists; I wasn't going to just leave. \"Come on,\" I said. \"There has to be\nI can do.\"\nAmy shook her head and gave one of those ironic laughs that mean the person doesn't think you've got a snowball's chance in hell. \"I'll tell you what. Yes, there is something you can do: Volunteer at a suicide hotline. Then come talk to me. No guarantees, got it?\" she said. \"Now, seriously,\nMy conversation with Amy kicked off my awareness of the complex and hidden subtleties of conversation, the power of certain words, the seemingly unintelligible emotional truths that so often underlie intelligible exchanges.

A trap into which many fall is to take what other people say literally. I started to see that while people played the game of conversation, it was in the game beneath the game, where few played, that all the leverage lived. In our chat, I saw how the word \"No\"-so apparently clear and direct-really wasn't so simple. Over the years, I've thought back repeatedly to that conversation, replaying how Amy so quickly turned me down, again and again. But her \"No's\" were just the gateway to \"Yes.\" They gave her-and me-time to pivot, adjust, and reexamine, and actually created the environment for the one \"Yes\" that mattered. While assigned to the JTTF, I worked with an NYPD lieutenant named Martin. He had a hard shell, and whenever asked for anything\nhe responded with a terse negative. After I'd gotten to know him a bit, I asked him why. \"Chris,\" he said, proudly, \"a lieutenant's job is to say, 'No.'\"\nAt first, I thought that sort of automated response signaled a failure of imagination. But then I realized I did the same thing with my teenage son, and that after I'd said \"No\" to him, I often found that I was open to hearing what he had to say. That's because having protected myself, I could relax and more easily consider the possibilities. \"No\" is the\nof the negotiation, not the\nof it. We've been conditioned to fear the word \"No.\" But it is a statement of perception far more often than of fact. It seldom means, \"I have considered all the facts and made a rational choice.\" Instead, \"No\" is often a decision, frequently temporary, to maintain the status quo. Change is scary, and \"No\" provides a little protection from that scariness. Jim Camp, in his excellent book,\nStart with NO\ncounsels the reader to give their adversary (his word for counterpart) permission to say \"No\" from the outset of a negotiation. He calls it \"the right to veto.\" He observes that people will fight to the death to preserve their right to say \"No,\" so give them that right and the negotiating environment becomes more constructive and collaborative almost immediately. When I read Camp's book, I realized this was something we'd known as hostage negotiators for years. We'd learned that the quickest way to get a hostage-taker out was to take the time to talk them out, as opposed to \"demanding\" their surrender. Demanding their surrender, \"telling\" them to come out, always ended up creating a much longer standoff and occasionally, actually contributed to death. It comes down to the deep and universal human need for autonomy. People need to feel in control. When you preserve a person's autonomy by clearly giving them permission to say \"No\" to your ideas, the emotions calm, the effectiveness of the decisions go up, and the\nother party can really look at your proposal. They're allowed to hold it in their hands, to turn it around. And it gives you time to elaborate or pivot in order to convince your counterpart that the change you're proposing is more advantageous than the status quo. Great negotiators seek \"No\" because they know that's often when the real negotiation begins. Politely saying \"No\" to your opponent (we'll go into this in more depth in Chapter 9), calmly hearing \"No,\" and just letting the other side know that they are welcome to say \"No\" has a positive impact on any negotiation. In fact, your invitation for the other side to say \"No\" has an amazing power to bring down barriers and allow for beneficial communication. This means you have to train yourself to hear \"No\" as something other than rejection, and respond accordingly. When someone tells you \"No,\" you need to rethink the word in one of its alternative-and much more real-meanings:\nI am not yet ready to agree;\nYou are making me feel uncomfortable;\nI do not understand;\nI don't think I can afford it;\nI want something else;\nI need more information; or\nI want to talk it over with someone else. Then, after pausing, ask solution-based questions or simply label their effect:\n\"What about this doesn't work for you?\"\n\"What would you need to make it work?\"\n\"It seems like there's something here that bothers you.\"\nPeople have a need to say, \"No.\" So don't just hope to hear it at some point; get them to say it early. PERSUADE IN THEIR WORLD\nI'd like to present you with a guy named Joe Businessman as he readies himself for a negotiation. You've met him before. He's the prepared type, with all his\nGetting to Yes\nstrategies written out and memorized. And he's\nthan ready to unleash them on the guy across the table.

For now, they just want to be released because Joe isn't convincing them of anything; he's only convincing himself. I'll let you in on a secret. There are actually three kinds of \"Yes\": Counterfeit, Confirmation, and Commitment. A counterfeit \"yes\" is one in which your counterpart plans on saying \"no\" but either feels \"yes\" is an easier escape route or just wants\nto disingenuously keep the conversation going to obtain more information or some other kind of edge. A confirmation \"yes\" is generally innocent, a reflexive response to a black-or-white question; it's sometimes used to lay a trap but mostly it's just simple affirmation with no promise of action. And a commitment \"yes\" is the real deal; it's a true agreement that leads to action, a \"yes\" at the table that ends with a signature on the contract. The commitment \"yes\" is what you want, but the three types sound almost the same so you have to learn how to recognize which one is being used. Human beings the world over are so used to being pursued for the commitment \"yes\" as a condition to find out more that they have become masters at giving the counterfeit \"yes.\" That's what the people facing Joe Businessman are doing, dangling the counterfeit \"yes\" so they can hear more. Whether you call it \"buy-in\" or \"engagement\" or something else, good negotiators know that their job isn't to put on a great performance but to gently guide their counterpart to discover their goal as his own. Let me tell you, I learned that the hard way. Two months after talking with Amy, I started answering phones for HelpLine, the crisis hotline founded by Norman Vincent Peale. The basic rule was that you couldn't be with anybody on the phone for more than twenty minutes. If you did your job, it wasn't going to take you longer than that to get them to a better place. We had a thick book of organizations we referred them to for help. It was a paramedic approach: patch them up and send them on their way. But people in crisis only accounted for about 40 percent of the calls we got. The majority of the calls came from frequent callers. These are highly dysfunctional people, energy vampires whom no one else would listen to anymore. We kept a list of frequent callers and when you got one, the first thing you had to do was check to see if the person had called that day,\nbecause they were only allowed one call a day. They knew it, too. A lot of times, they'd say, \"Yeah, I'm Eddie. I haven't called yet today. Go ahead and check the list. You got to talk to me.\"\nSince I was there primarily to learn a skill, I loved the frequent callers. They were a problem, and I loved trying to figure them out. I felt I had some talent at it. I felt like a superstar. When it came time for my performance review, they assigned me a shift supervisor named Jim Snyder. Jim was a hotline veteran and a sweetheart; the only problem was he always wanted to joke around. Jim understood that volunteer burnout was the biggest problem at a hotline, so he dedicated his time to making work fun. I became good friends with Jim. For my review, Jim waited until I got a call and went into the monitoring room where the supervisors could listen to our calls. The call was from one of my frequent clients, a cabbie with a fear of going outside and plenty of time to tell me about it. This energy vampire (his name was Daryl) launched into his shtick about how he was going to lose his house and with it his will to live if he couldn't work. \"Seriously, when was the last time someone tried to hurt you on the streets?\" I asked. \"Well, I mean, it's been a long time,\" Daryl said. \"Like . . . ?\"\n\"I can't really remember a date, Chris. Maybe a year, I guess.\"\n\"So it's safe to say that the outside world hasn't been\nhard on you, right?\"\n\"Yes,\" Daryl said. \"I suppose so.\"\nWe went back and forth like this for a while, as I made him admit that most of us had little to fear in the world. I was feeling good about my new skills, about listening to Daryl and then \"CareFronting\" him, which was the slightly goofy name we gave to assertively-but caringly-responding to frequent callers. It was all flowing, and our rapport was great. I even got Daryl to laugh a few times. By the time I was done with him, he couldn't give me one reason not to step outside. \"Thank you, Chris,\" Daryl said just before he hung up. \"Thanks for doing such a great job.\"\nBefore I went to see Jim, I leaned back in my chair and basked in that compliment. How often do you get that from a man in pain, I thought.",

How often do you get that from a man in pain, I thought. Then I sprung up and strode toward the monitoring room, so proud I was practically buffing my nails on my shirt and patting my own back. Jim motioned me to the chair in front of him and gave me his biggest smile. I must have returned it with twice the wattage. \"Well, Chris,\" he said, still smiling. \"That was one of the worst calls I ever heard.\"\nI stared at him, gape-jawed. \"Jim, did you hear Daryl congratulate me?\" I asked. \"I talked him down, man. I killed it.\"\nJim smiled-I hated that smile right then-and nodded. \"That's one of the signs, because they should be congratulating themselves when they get off the line,\" he said. \"They don't need to be congratulating you. That tells me you did too much. If they think you did it-if you were the guy who killed it-how is he going to help himself? I don't want to be harsh, but you were horrible.\"\nAs I listened to what Jim said, I felt that acid stomach rush you get when you are forced to accept that the guy dumping on you is completely right. Daryl's response had been a kind of \"yes,\" but it had been anything but a true commitment \"yes.\" He'd made no promise to action. His \"yes\" had been designed to make me feel good enough to leave him alone. Daryl may not have known it, but his \"yes\" was as counterfeit as they came. You see, that whole call had been about me and my ego and not the caller. But the only way to get these callers to take action was to have\nthem own the conversation, to believe that they were coming to these conclusions, to these necessary next steps, and that the voice at the other end was simply a medium for those realizations. Using all your skills to create rapport, agreement, and connection with a counterpart is useful, but ultimately that connection is useless unless the other person feels that they are equally as responsible, if not\nresponsible, for creating the connection and the new ideas they have. I nodded slowly, the fight drained out of me. \"One of the worst calls?\" I said to Jim. \"That's right.\"\nI worked hard at reorienting myself from that point on. I asked so many questions and read so much about it that soon they had me teaching two classes for new volunteers at HelpLine: the opening class, on active listening; and the one on CareFrontation. Got it, you say. It's not about me. We need to persuade from their perspective, not ours. But how? By starting with their most basic wants. In every negotiation, in every agreement, the result comes from someone else's decision. And sadly, if we believe that we can control or manage others' decisions with compromise and logic, we're leaving millions on the table. But while we can't control others' decisions, we can influence them by inhabiting their world and seeing and hearing exactly what they want. Though the intensity may differ from person to person, you can be sure that everyone you meet is driven by two primal urges: the need to feel safe and secure, and the need to feel in control. If you satisfy those drives, you're in the door. As we saw with my chat with Daryl, you're not going to logically\nthem that they're safe, secure, or in control. Primal needs are urgent and illogical, so arguing them into a corner is just going to push your counterpart to flee with a counterfeit \"Yes.\"\nAnd being \"nice\" in the form of feigned sympathy is often equally as unsuccessful. We live in an age that celebrates niceness under various names. We are exhorted to be nice and to respect people's feelings at all times and in every situation. But nice alone in the context of negotiation can backfire. Nice, employed as a ruse, is disingenuous and manipulative. Who hasn't received the short end of the stick in dealings with a \"nice\" salesman who took you for a ride? If you rush in with plastic niceness, your bland smile is going to dredge up all that baggage. Instead of getting inside with logic or feigned smiles, then, we get there by asking for \"No.\" It's the word that gives the speaker feelings of safety and control. \"No\" starts conversations and creates safe havens to get to the final \"Yes\" of commitment. An early \"Yes\" is often just a cheap, counterfeit dodge. About five months after she'd told me to \"go away,\" I stopped by Amy Bonderow's office and told her that I'd volunteered at HelpLine. \"You did?\" she asked, smiling with surprise. \"I tell everybody to do that. And nobody ever does.\"\nIt turned out that Amy had started her negotiating career by volunteering at the same place. She started naming people who were now mutual friends of ours. We laughed about Jim. In a sudden shift, Amy stopped speaking and stared at me. I shifted in my shoes as she gave me the Pause. Then she smiled. \"You get the next position.\"\nAt that time, there were five other people aiming for the same slot, people who had psychology degrees, experience, and credentials. But I was on the road to the next hostage negotiation training course at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, ahead of everybody else.",

In a sudden shift, Amy stopped speaking and stared at me. I shifted in my shoes as she gave me the Pause.

But I was on the road to the next hostage negotiation training course at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, ahead of everybody else. My career as a negotiator had officially begun. \"NO\" IS PROTECTION\nThink back to the telemarketer at the beginning of this chapter. The obvious reply to his question-\"Do you enjoy a nice glass of water?\"-is \"Yes.\" But all you want to do is scream, \"No!\" After a question like that you just know the rest of the phone call is going to be painful. That, in a nutshell, distills the inherent contradictions in the values we give \"Yes\" and \"No.\" Whenever we negotiate, there's no doubt we want to finish with a \"Yes.\" But we mistakenly conflate the positive value of that final \"Yes\" with a positive value of \"Yes\" in general. And because we see \"No\" as the opposite of \"Yes,\" we then assume that \"No\" is always a bad thing. Nothing could be further from the truth. Saying \"No\" gives the speaker the feeling of safety, security, and control. You use a question that prompts a \"No\" answer, and your counterpart feels that by turning you down he has proved that he's in the driver's seat. Good negotiators welcome-even invite-a solid \"No\" to start, as a sign that the other party is engaged and thinking. Gun for a \"Yes\" straight off the bat, though, and your counterpart gets defensive, wary, and skittish. That's why I tell my students that, if you're trying to sell something, don't start with \"Do you have a few minutes to talk?\" Instead ask, \"Is now a bad time to talk?\" Either you get \"Yes, it is a bad time\" followed by a good time or a request to go away, or you get \"No, it's not\" and total focus. As an exercise, the next time you get a telemarketing call, write down the questions the seller asks. I promise you'll find that your level of discomfort correlates directly to how quickly he pushes you for \"Yes.\"\nMy colleague Marti Evelsizer was the one who first opened my eyes to why \"No\" was better than \"Yes.\"\nMarti was the FBI's Crisis Negotiation Coordinator in Pittsburgh at the time. She was a dynamo and a negotiating genius, which earned\nher huge respect both within the Bureau and with the local police. But human beings are innately jealous, and her immediate supervisor was no exception to that rule. Her success diminished him, and that made her a threat. His jealousy got the better of him when the Pittsburgh Police Department's Hostage Negotiation Team asked her to sit on the selection board for their new candidates. Picking her, and doing so over her boss, was an unprecedented move. So her boss decided to remove her from her position. For ignoring her regular duties, he said. But really it was for being a threat. When Marti sat down with her supervisor for her official dismissal, her options were few. He had every right to do as he pleased. Marti told me that she considered a variety of scenarios. She thought about going right at his jealousy and hashing it out, or explaining how the job would reflect well on the Bureau: \"Would you like our office to be honored for its expertise?\"\nBut by the time she sat down with him, she had picked one of the most strongly worded \"No\"-oriented setup questions I have ever heard. \"Do you want the FBI to be embarrassed?\" she said. \"No,\" he answered. \"What do you want me to do?\" she responded. He leaned back in his chair, one of those 1950s faux-leather numbers that squeak meaningfully when the sitter shifts. He stared at her over his glasses and then nodded ever so slightly. He was in control. \"Look, you can keep the position,\" he said. \"Just go back out there and don't let it interfere with your other duties.\"\nAnd a minute later Marti walked out with her job intact. When I heard Marti do that, I was like, \"Bang!\" By pushing for a \"No,\" Marti nudged her supervisor into a zone where he was making the decisions. And then she furthered his feelings of safety and power with a question inviting him to define her next move. The important thing here is that Marti not only accepted the \"No\"; she searched it out and embraced it. At a recent sales conference, I asked the participants for the one word they all dread. The entire group yelled, \"No!\" To them-and to almost everyone-\"No\" means one thing: end of discussion. But that's not what it means. \"No\" is not failure. Used strategically it's an answer that opens the path forward. Getting to the point where you're no longer horrified by the word \"No\" is a liberating moment that every negotiator needs to reach. Because if your biggest fear is \"No,\" you can't negotiate. You're the hostage of \"Yes.\" You're handcuffed. You're done. So let's undress \"No.\" It's a reaffirmation of autonomy. It is not a use or abuse of power; it is not an act of rejection; it is not a manifestation of stubbornness; it is not the end of the negotiation. In fact, \"No\" often opens the discussion up. The sooner you say \"No,\" the sooner you're willing to see options and opportunities that you were blind to previously. Saying \"No\" often spurs people to action because they feel they've protected themselves and now see an opportunity slipping away.",

The sooner you say \"No,\" the sooner you're willing to see options and opportunities that you were blind to previously. Saying \"No\" often spurs people to action because they feel they've protected themselves and now see an opportunity slipping away. Since I've demystified \"No\" for myself, I've found the ideas, perceptions, and baggage that people have with that two-letter word to be fascinating. To me, it's like watching a movie or a music video from the 1980s for the umpteenth time. You can identify with the experience-while simultaneously being conscious of the fact that the world, and you, have moved on. Today, I coach my students to learn to see \"No\" for what it is. Rather than harming them or those they negotiate with, \"No\" protects and benefits all parties in an exchange. \"No\" creates safety, security, and the feeling of control. It's a requirement to implementable success. It's a pause, a nudge, and a chance for the speaker to articulate what they do want. As you can see, \"No\" has a lot of skills. \"No\" allows the real issues to be brought forth;\n\"No\" protects people from making-and lets them correct-ineffective decisions;\n\"No\" slows things down so that people can freely embrace their decisions and the agreements they enter into;\n\"No\" helps people feel safe, secure, emotionally comfortable, and in control of their decisions;\n\"No\" moves everyone's efforts forward. One of my grad school students, a political fund-raiser named Ben Ottenhoff, drove home this lesson with a bang. For years, he'd been using a traditional \"Yes pattern\" fund-raising script to raise money for Republican congressional candidates. FUND-RAISER:\nHello, can I speak with Mr. Smith? MR. SMITH:\nYes, this is he. FUND-RAISER:\nI'm calling from the XYZ Committee, and I wanted to ask you a few important questions about your views on our economy today. Do you believe that gas prices are currently too high? MR. SMITH:\nYes, gas prices are much too high and hurting my family. FUND-RAISER:\nDo you believe that the Democrats are part of the problem when it comes to high gas prices? MR. SMITH:\nYes, President Obama is a bad person\nFUND-RAISER:\nDo you think we need change in November? MR. SMITH:\nYes, I do. FUND-RAISER:\nCan you give me your credit card number so you can be a part of that change? In theory at least, the \"Yes\" answers built up a reservoir of positivity that exploded into donations when requested at the end of the script. The problem, in reality, was that the \"Yes pattern\" scripts had been giving poor rates of return for years. All the steps were \"Yes,\" but the final answer was invariably \"No.\"\nThen Ben read Jim Camp's book\nStart with NO\nin my class and began to wonder if \"No\" could be a tool to boost donations. Ben knew that giving the potential donors a no-hard-feelings way to get off the call was going to be a tough sell to his grassroots fund-raisers, because it goes against everything they had been trained to do. But Ben's a smart guy, so instead of totally swapping scripts he had a small group of his grassroots guys test-market a \"No\"-oriented script. FUND-RAISER:\nHello, can I speak with Mr. Smith? MR. SMITH:\nYes, this is he. FUND-RAISER:\nI'm calling from the XYZ Committee, and I wanted to ask you a few important questions about your views on our economy today. Do you feel that if things stay the way they are, America's best days are ahead of it? MR. SMITH:\nNo, things will only get worse. FUND-RAISER:\nAre you going to sit and watch President Obama take the White House in November without putting up a fight? MR. SMITH:\nNo, I'm going to do anything I can to make sure that doesn't happen. FUND-RAISER:\nIf you want do something today to make sure that doesn't happen, you can give to XYZ Committee, which is working hard to fight for you. See how clearly that swaps \"Yes\" for \"No\" and offers to take a donation if Mr. Smith\n? It puts Mr. Smith in the driver's seat; he's\nin charge. And it works! In a truly remarkable turnaround, the \"No\"-oriented script got a\n23 percent better rate of return\nThe only sad part of Ben's tale is that despite the huge improvement in results, he couldn't roll out the script to all his fund-raisers. It went against fund-raising orthodoxy, and longtime fund-raisers like the fake comfort of the \"Yes.\" Genius is often missed the first time around, right? One negotiating genius who's impossible to miss is Mark Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks. I always quote to my students one of his best lines on negotiation: \"Every 'No' gets me closer to a 'Yes.'\" But then I remind them that extracting those \"No's\" on the road to \"Yes\" isn't always easy. There is a big difference between making your counterpart feel that they can say \"No\" and actually getting them to say it. Sometimes, if you're talking to somebody who is just not listening, the only way you can crack their cranium is to antagonize them into \"No.\"\nOne great way to do this is to mislabel one of the other party's emotions or desires. You say something that you know is totally wrong, like \"So it seems that you really are eager to leave your job\" when they clearly want to stay. That forces them to listen and makes them comfortable correcting you by saying, \"No, that's not it. This is it.\"\nAnother way to force \"No\" in a negotiation is to ask the other party what they\nwant.",

And people are comfortable saying \"No\" here because it feels like self-protection. And once you've gotten them to say \"No,\" people are much more open to moving forward toward new options and ideas. \"No\"-or the lack thereof-also serves as a warning, the canary in the coal mine. If despite all your efforts, the other party won't say \"No,\" you're dealing with people who are indecisive or confused or\nwho have a hidden agenda. In cases like that you have to end the negotiation and walk away. Think of it like this: No \"No\" means no go. EMAIL MAGIC: HOW NEVER TO BE IGNORED AGAIN\nThere's nothing more irritating than being ignored. Being turned down is bad, but getting no response at all is the pits. It makes you feel invisible, as if you don't exist. And it's a waste of your time. We've all been through it: You send an email to someone you're trying to do business with and they ignore you. Then you send a polite follow-up and they stonewall you again. So what do you do? You provoke a \"No\" with this one-sentence email. Have you given up on this project? The point is that this one-sentence email encapsulates the best of \"No\"-oriented questions and plays on your counterpart's natural human aversion to loss. The \"No\" answer the email demands offers the other party the feeling of safety and the illusion of control while encouraging them to define their position and explain it to you. Just as important, it makes the implicit threat that you will walk away on your own terms. To stop that from happening-to cut their losses and prove their power-the other party's natural inclination is to reply immediately and disagree. No, our priorities haven't changed. We've just gotten bogged down and . . . If you're a parent, you already use this technique instinctively. What do you do when your kids won't leave the house/park/mall? You say, \"Fine. I'm leaving,\" and you begin to walk away. I'm going to guess that well over half the time they yell, \"No, wait!\" and run to catch up. No one likes to be abandoned. Now, this may seem like a rude way to address someone in business, but you have to get over that. It's not rude, and though it's direct, it's cloaked with the safety of \"No.\" Ignoring you is what's rude. I can tell you that I've used this successfully not just in North America, but with people in two different cultures (Arabic and Chinese) famous for never saying \"No.\"\nKEY LESSONS\nUsing this chapter's tools in daily life is difficult for many people because they go directly against one of society's biggest social dictums. That is, \"Be nice.\"\nWe've instrumentalized niceness as a way of greasing the social wheels, yet it's often a ruse. We're polite and we don't disagree to get through daily existence with the least degree of friction. But by turning niceness into a lubricant, we've leeched it of meaning. A smile and a nod might signify \"Get me out of here!\" as much as it means \"Nice to meet you.\"\nThat's death for a good negotiator, who gains their power by understanding their counterpart's situation and extracting information about their counterpart's desires and needs. Extracting that information means getting the other party to feel safe and in control. And while it may sound contradictory, the way to get there is by getting the other party to disagree, to draw their own boundaries, to define their desires as a function of what they do not want. As you try to put the chapter's methods to use, I encourage you to think of them as the anti-\"niceness ruse.\" Not in the sense that they are unkind, but in the sense that they are authentic. Triggering \"No\" peels away the plastic falsehood of \"Yes\" and gets you to what's really at stake. Along the way, keep in mind these powerful lessons:\nBreak the habit of attempting to get people to say \"yes.\" Being pushed for \"yes\" makes people defensive. Our love of hearing \"yes\" makes us blind to the defensiveness we ourselves feel when someone is pushing us to say it. \"No\" is not a failure. We have learned that \"No\" is the anti-\"Yes\" and therefore a word to be avoided at all costs. But it really often just means \"Wait\" or \"I'm not comfortable with that.\" Learn how to hear it calmly. It is not the end of the negotiation, but the beginning. \"Yes\" is the final goal of a negotiation, but don't aim for it at the start. Asking someone for \"Yes\" too quickly in a conversation-\"Do you like to drink water, Mr. Smith?\"-gets his guard up and paints you as an untrustworthy salesman. Saying \"No\" makes the speaker feel safe, secure, and in control, so trigger it. By saying what they don't want, your counterpart defines their space and gains the confidence and comfort to listen to you.",

So don't beat them with logic or brute force. Ask\nthem questions that open paths to your goals. It's not about you\nIf a potential business partner is ignoring you, contact them with a clear and concise \"No\"-oriented question that suggests that you are ready to walk away. \"Have you given up on this project?\" works wonders.",

      "text": "TRIGGER THE TWO WORDS THAT IMMEDIATELY TRANSFORM ANY NEGOTIATION\nn August 2000, the militant Islamic group Abu Sayyaf, in the southern Philippines, broadcast that it had captured a CIA agent. The truth was not as newsworthy, or as valuable to the rebels. Abu Sayyaf had kidnapped Jeffrey Schilling, a twenty-four-year-old American who had traveled near their base in Jolo Island. A California native, Schilling became a hostage with a $10 million price tag on his head. At the time I was a Supervisory Special Agent (SSA) attached to the FBI's elite Crisis Negotiation Unit (CNU). The CNU is the equivalent of the special forces of negotiations. It's attached to the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team (HRT). Both are national counterterrorist response assets. They are the best of the best. The CNU is based at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia. The FBI Academy has come to be known by the one word, \"Quantico.\" Rightly or wrongly, Quantico has developed the reputation as one of the centers, if not\ncenter of knowledge, for law enforcement. When a negotiation is going badly and the negotiators involved are directed to call and find out what \"Quantico\" has to say, the CNU is who they call. CNU developed what is a powerful staple in the high-stakes world of crisis negotiation, the Behavioral Change Stairway Model (BCSM). The model proposes five stages-active listening, empathy, rapport, influence, and behavioral change-that take any negotiator from listening to influencing behavior. The origins of the model can be traced back to the great American psychologist Carl Rogers, who proposed that real change can only come when a therapist accepts the client as he or she is-an approach known as unconditional positive regard. The vast majority of us, however, as Rogers explained, come to expect that love, praise, and approval are dependent on saying and doing the things people (initially, our parents) consider correct. That is, because for most of us the positive regard we experience is conditional, we develop a habit of hiding who we really are and what we really think, instead calibrating our words to gain approval but disclosing little. Which is why so few social interactions lead to actual behavior change. Consider the typical patient with severe coronary heart disease recovering from open-heart surgery. The doctor tells the patient: \"This surgery isn't a cure. The only way to truly prolong your life is to make the following behavior changes . . .\" The grateful patient responds: \"Yes, yes, yes, of course, Doctor! This is my second chance. I will change!\"\nAnd do they? Study after study has shown that, no, nothing changes; two years after their operation, more than 90 percent of patients haven't changed their lifestyle at all. Though the stakes of an everyday negotiation with your child, boss, or client are usually not as high as that of a hostage (or health crisis) negotiation, the psychological environment necessary for not just temporary in-the-moment compliance, but real gut-level change, is the same. If you successfully take someone up the Behavioral Change Stairway, each stage attempting to engender more trust and more\nconnection, there will be a breakthrough moment when unconditional positive regard is established and you can begin exerting influence. After years of refining the BCSM and its tactics, I can teach anyone how to get to that moment. But as cardiologists know all too well, and legions of B-school grads weaned on the most famous negotiating book in the world,\nGetting to Yes\n, have ultimately discovered, you more than likely haven't gotten there yet if what you're hearing is the word \"yes.\"\nAs you'll soon learn, the sweetest two words in any negotiation are actually \"That's right.\"\nCREATE A SUBTLE EPIPHANY\nI was a natural for the Schilling case. I had spent some time in the Philippines and had an extensive background in terrorism from my New York City days assigned to the Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF). A few days after Schilling became a hostage, my partner Chuck Regini and I flew to Manila to run the negotiations. Along with Jim Nixon, the FBI's highest official in Manila, we conferred with top Philippine military brass. They agreed to let us guide the negotiations. Then we got down to business. One of us would take charge of the negotiation strategy for the FBI and consequently for the U.S. government. That became my role. With the support of my colleagues, my job was to come up with the strategy, get it approved, and implement it. As a result of the Schilling case, I would become the FBI's lead international kidnapping negotiator. Our principal adversary was Abu Sabaya, the rebel leader who personally negotiated for Schilling's ransom. Sabaya was a veteran of the rebel movement with a violent past. He was straight out of the movies,\na terrorist-sociopath-killer. He had a history of rape, murder, and beheadings. He liked to record his bloody deeds on video and send them to the Philippine media. Sabaya always wore sunglasses, a bandana, a black T-shirt, and camo pants. He thought it made him a more dashing figure. If you look for any photos of Abu Sayyaf terrorists from this period, you always see one in sunglasses. That's Sabaya. Sabaya loved, loved, loved the media. He had the Philippine reporters on speed dial. They'd call him and ask him questions in Tagalog, his native tongue. He would answer in English because he wanted the world to hear his voice on CNN. \"They should make a movie about me,\" he would tell reporters. In my eyes, Sabaya was a cold-blooded businessman with an ego as big as Texas. A real shark. Sabaya knew he was in the commodities game. In Jeffrey Schilling, he had an item of value. How much could he get for it? He would find out, and I intended it to be a surprise he wouldn't like. As an FBI agent, I wanted to free the hostage and bring the criminal to justice.",

How much could he get for it? He would find out, and I intended it to be a surprise he wouldn't like. As an FBI agent, I wanted to free the hostage and bring the criminal to justice. One crucial aspect of any negotiation is to figure out how your adversary arrived at his position. Sabaya threw out the $10 million ransom based on a business calculation. First, the United States was offering $5 million for information leading to the arrest of any of the remaining fugitives from the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Sabaya reasoned that if the United States would pay $5 million to get its hands on someone it didn't like, it would pay much more for a citizen. Second, a rival faction of the Abu Sayyaf had just reportedly been paid $20 million for six Western European captives. Libyan strongman Muammar Gaddafi had made the payment as \"development aid.\" This absurdity had been compounded by a significant portion of the ransom being paid in counterfeit bills. It was an opportunity for Gaddafi to both embarrass Western governments and get money\nover-the-table to groups with whom he sympathized. I'm sure he laughed about that episode until the day he died. Regardless, a price had been set. Sabaya did the math and figured Schilling was worth $10 million. Problem was, Jeff Schilling came from a working-class family. His mother could come up with $10,000, perhaps. The United States wasn't about to pay one dollar. But we would allow a payment to be made if it could be run as a \"sting\" operation. If we could draw Sabaya into an offer-counteroffer bargaining situation, we had a bargaining system that worked every time. We could beat him down to where we wanted him, get the hostage out, and set up the \"sting.\"\nFor months Sabaya refused to budge. He argued that Muslims in the Philippines had suffered five hundred years of oppression, since Spanish missionaries had brought Catholicism to the Philippines in the sixteenth century. He recited instances where atrocities had been committed against his Islamic forebears. He explained why the Abu Sayyaf wanted to establish an Islamic state in the southern Philippines. Fishing rights had been violated. You name it, he thought it up and used it. Sabaya wanted $10 million in war damages-not ransom, but war damages. He held firm in his demand and kept us out of the offer-counteroffer system we wanted to use against him. And he occasionally dropped in threats that he was torturing Jeff Schilling. Sabaya negotiated directly with Benjie, a Filipino military officer. They talked in Tagalog. We reviewed transcripts translated to English and used them to advise Benjie. I rotated in and out of Manila and oversaw the talks and strategy. I instructed Benjie to ask what Schilling had to do with five hundred years of bad blood between Muslims and Filipinos. He told Sabaya that $10 million was not possible. No matter what approach we took to \"reason\" with Sabaya over\nwhy Schilling had nothing to do with the \"war damages,\" it fell on deaf ears. Our first \"that's right\" breakthrough actually came when I was negotiating with Benjie. He was a true Filipino patriot and hero. He was the leader of the Philippine National Police's Special Action Force and had been in his share of firefights. On many occasions, Benjie and his men had been sent on rescue missions to save hostages, and they had a sterling record. His men were feared, for good reason. They rarely took handcuffs. Benjie wanted to take a hard line with Sabaya and speak to him in direct, no-nonsense terms. We wanted to engage Sabaya in dialogue to discover what made the adversary tick. We actually wanted to establish rapport with an adversary. To Benjie that was distasteful. Benjie told us he needed a break. We had been working him nearly twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week for several weeks. He wanted to spend some time with his family in the mountains north of Manila. We agreed, but only on the condition that we could accompany him and spend several hours both on Saturday and Sunday working on negotiation strategy. That Saturday night we sat in the library of the American ambassador's summer residence working on the strategy. As I was explaining to Benjie the value of establishing a rapport-based, working relationship, even with an adversary as dangerous as Sabaya, I could see a snarl coming over his face. I realized I needed to negotiate with Benjie. \"You hate Sabaya, don't you?\" I said, leading with a label. Benjie unloaded on me. \"I tell you I\n!\" he said. \"He has murdered and raped. He has come up on our radio when we were lobbing mortars on his position and said 'these mortars are music to my ears.' I heard his voice come on our radio one day and celebrate that he was standing over the body of one of my men.\"\nThis outburst was Benjie's equivalent of \"that's right.\" As he acknowledged his rage, I watched him get control of his anger and\ncalm down. Though he had been very good up to that point, from that moment forward Benjie became a superstar. He blossomed into a truly talented negotiator. This \"negotiation\" between Benjie and me was no different than any other negotiation between colleagues who disagree on a strategy.",

      "text": "'these mortars are music to my ears.' I heard his voice come on our radio one day and celebrate that he was standing over the body of one of my men.\" This outburst was Benjie's equivalent of \"that's right.\" As he acknowledged his rage, I watched him get control of his anger and calm down. Though he had been very good up to that point, from that moment forward Benjie became a superstar. He blossomed into a truly talented negotiator. This \"negotiation\" between Benjie and me was no different than any other negotiation between colleagues who disagree on a strategy. Before you convince them to see what you're trying to accomplish, you have to say the things to them that will get them to say, \"That's right.\"\nThe \"that's right\" breakthrough usually doesn't come at the beginning of a negotiation. It's invisible to the counterpart when it occurs, and they embrace what you've said. To them, it's a subtle epiphany. TRIGGER A \"THAT'S RIGHT!\" WITH A SUMMARY\nAfter four months of negotiations, Sabaya still refused to budge. I decided it was time to hit the reset switch. Benjie had gotten so good at extending the conversations that you could tell that there were times that Sabaya must have paced back and forth for an hour before calling Benjie, trying to figure out how to get what he wanted. He would call in and say, \"Tell me yes or no! Just yes or no!\"\nWe had to get Sabaya off this war damages nonsense. No matter what type of questioning, logic, or reasoning we tried with him, he wouldn't release it. Threats against Schilling came and went. We talked him down each time. I decided that in order to break through this phase we needed to reposition Sabaya with his own words in a way that would dissolve barriers. We needed to get him to say, \"That's right.\" At the time, I didn't know for sure what kind of breakthrough it was going to give us. I just knew we needed to trust the process. I wrote a two-page document that instructed Benjie to change course. We were going to use nearly every tactic in the active listening arsenal:\nEffective Pauses: Silence is powerful. We told Benjie to use it for emphasis, to encourage Sabaya to keep talking until eventually, like clearing out a swamp, the emotions were drained from the dialogue. Minimal Encouragers: Besides silence, we instructed using simple phrases, such as \"Yes,\" \"OK,\" \"Uh-huh,\" or \"I see,\" to effectively convey that Benjie was now paying full attention to Sabaya and all he had to say. Mirroring: Rather than argue with Sabaya and try to separate Schilling from the \"war damages,\" Benjie would listen and repeat back what Sabaya said. Labeling: Benjie should give Sabaya's feelings a name and identify with how he felt. \"It all seems so tragically unfair, I can now see why you sound so angry.\"\nParaphrase: Benjie should repeat what Sabaya is saying back to him in Benjie's own words. This, we told him, would powerfully show him you really do understand and aren't merely parroting his concerns. Summarize: A good summary is the combination of rearticulating the meaning of what is said plus the acknowledgment of the emotions underlying that meaning (paraphrasing + labeling = summary). We told Benjie he needed to listen and repeat the \"world according to Abu Sabaya.\" He needed to fully and completely summarize all the nonsense that Sabaya had come up with about war damages and fishing rights and five hundred years of oppression. And once he did that fully and completely, the only possible response for Sabaya, and anyone faced with a good summary, would be \"that's right.\"\nTwo days later Sabaya phoned Benjie. Sabaya spoke. Benjie listened. When he spoke, he followed my script: he commiserated with the rebel group's predicament. Mirroring, encouraging, labeling, each tactic worked seamlessly and cumulatively to soften Sabaya up and begin shifting his perspective. Finally, Benjie repeated in his own words Sabaya's version of history and the emotions that came with that version. Sabaya was silent for nearly a minute. Finally he spoke. \"That's right,\" he said. We ended the call. The \"war damages\" demand just disappeared. From that point forward Sabaya never mentioned money again. He never asked for another dime for the release of Jeffrey Schilling. He ultimately became so weary of this case and holding the young Californian that he let down his guard. Schilling escaped from their camp, and Philippine commandoes swooped in and rescued him. He returned safely to his family in California. Two weeks after Jeff Schilling escaped, Sabaya called Benjie:\n\"Have you been promoted yet?\" he asked. \"If not, you should have been.\"\n\"Why?\" Benjie asked. \"I was going to hurt Jeffrey,\" Sabaya said. \"I don't know what you did to keep me from doing that, but whatever it was, it worked.\"\nIn June 2002 Sabaya was killed in a shoot-out with Philippine military units. In the heat of negotiations for a man's life, I didn't appreciate the value of those two words: \"That's right.\" But when I studied the transcripts and reconstructed the trajectory of the negotiations, I realized that Sabaya had changed course when he uttered those words. Benjie had used some fundamental techniques that we had developed over many years. He had reflected Sabaya's vision. He had stepped back from\nconfrontation. He had allowed Sabaya to speak freely and exhaust his version of events. \"That's right\" signaled that negotiations could proceed from deadlock. It broke down a barrier that was impeding progress. It created a realization point with our adversary where he actually agreed on a point without the feeling of having given in. It was a stealth victory. When your adversaries say, \"That's right,\" they feel they have assessed what you've said and pronounced it as correct of their own free will. They embrace it. \"That's right\" allowed us to draw out the talks and divert Sabaya from hurting Schilling.",

They embrace it. \"That's right\" allowed us to draw out the talks and divert Sabaya from hurting Schilling. And it gave Philippine commandos time to mount their rescue operation. In hostage negotiations, we never tried to get to \"yes\" as an endpoint. We knew that \"yes\" is nothing without \"how.\" And when we applied hostage negotiating tactics to business, we saw how \"that's right\" often leads to the best outcomes. \"THAT'S RIGHT\" IS GREAT, BUT IF \"YOU'RE RIGHT,\" NOTHING CHANGES\nDriving toward \"that's right\" is a winning strategy in all negotiations. But hearing \"you're right\" is a disaster. Take my son, Brandon, and his development as a football player. He had been playing on the offensive and defensive lines all through high school. At six foot two and 250 pounds, he was formidable. He loved to knock every player wearing an opposing jersey to the ground. Having played quarterback, I didn't fully appreciate the blue-collar nature of being a lineman. Linemen are like mountain goats. They put their heads down and hit things. It makes them happy. At St. Thomas More prep school in Connecticut, Brandon's coach moved him to linebacker, and his role suddenly changed from hitting everything he saw to avoiding players who were trying to block him. He was supposed to play off blocks-dodge them, if you will-and get to the ball. But Brandon continued to confront opposing blockers head-on, which kept him from getting to the ballcarrier. His coach pleaded with him to avoid blockers, but Brandon couldn't change. He loved to hit. Flattening opposing players was a source of pride. Both his coach and I kept trying to explain it to him. And every time we got the worst possible answer-\"\nright.\" He agreed, in theory, but he didn't own the conclusion. Then he would go right back to the behavior we were trying to get him to stop. He would smash blockers and take himself out of the play. Why is \"you're right\" the worst answer? Consider this: Whenever someone is bothering you, and they just won't let up, and they won't listen to anything you have to say, what do you tell them to get them to shut up and go away? \"You're right.\"\nIt works every time. Tell people \"you're right\" and they get a happy smile on their face and leave you alone for at least twenty-four hours. But you haven't agreed to their position. You have used \"you're right\" to get them to quit bothering you. I was in the same situation with Brandon. He didn't hear me and embrace my request. What could I say to get through to this kid? How could I reach Brandon and help him change course? I thought back to Benjie and Sabaya. I took Brandon aside before a crucial game. I had searched my mind for a way to hear the two critical words, \"That's right.\"\n\"You seem to think it's unmanly to dodge a block,\" I told him. \"You think it's cowardly to get out of someone's way that's trying to hit you.\"\nBrandon stared at me and paused. \"That's right,\" he said. With those words Brandon embraced the reality of what was holding him back. Once he understood why he was trying to knock down every blocker, he changed course. He started avoiding the blocks and became an exceptionally fine linebacker. With Brandon on the field tackling and playing star linebacker, St. Thomas More School won every game. USING \"THAT'S RIGHT\" TO MAKE THE SALE\nGetting to \"that's right\" helped one of my students in her job as a sales representative for a large pharmaceutical company. She was trying to sell a new product to a doctor who used similar medication. He was the largest user of this kind of medication in her territory. The sale was critical to her success. In her first appointments, the doctor dismissed her product. He said it was no better than the ones he was already using. He was unfriendly. He didn't even want to hear her viewpoint. When she presented the positive attributes of her product, he interrupted her and knocked them down. Making the sales pitch, she soaked up as much as possible about the doctor. She learned that he was passionate about treating his patients. Each patient was special in his eyes. Improving their sense of calm and peace was the most important outcome for him. How could she put her understanding of his needs, desires, and passions to work for her? At her next visit, the doctor asked what medications she wanted to discuss. Rather than tout the benefits of her product, she talked about him and his practice. \"Doctor,\" she said, \"the last time I was in we spoke about your patients with this condition. I remember thinking that you seemed very\npassionate about treating them, and how you worked hard to tailor the specific treatment to each and every patient.\"\nHe looked her in the eyes as if he were seeing her for the first time. \"That's right,\" he said. \"I really feel like I'm treating an epidemic that other doctors are not picking up on-which means that a lot of patients are not getting treated adequately.\"\nShe told him he seemed to have a deep understanding of how to treat these patients, especially because some of them didn't respond to the usual medications. They talked about specific challenges he had confronted in treating his patients. He gave her examples.",

They talked about specific challenges he had confronted in treating his patients. He gave her examples. When he was finished, she summarized what he had said, especially the intricacies and problems in treatment. \"You seem to tailor specific treatments and medications for each patient,\" she said. \"That's right,\" he responded. This was the breakthrough she had hoped to reach. The doctor had been skeptical and cold. But when she recognized his passion for his patients-using a summary-the walls came down. He dropped his guard, and she was able to gain his trust. Rather than pitch her product, she let him describe his treatment and procedures. With this, she learned how her medication would fit into his practice. She then paraphrased what he said about the challenges of his practice and reflected them back to him. Once the doctor signaled his trust and rapport, she could tout the attributes of her product and describe precisely how it would help him reach the outcomes he desired for his patients. He listened intently. \"It might be perfect for treating a patient who has not benefited from the medication I have been prescribing,\" he told her. \"Let me give yours a try.\"\nShe made the sale. USING \"THAT'S RIGHT\" FOR CAREER SUCCESS\nOne of my Korean students got to \"that's right\" in negotiating with his ex-boss for a new job. Returning to Seoul after getting his MBA, he wanted to work in his company's consumer electronics division, rather than the semiconductor section, where he had been stationed. He was a human resources specialist. Under the company's rules, he believed he had to remain in his previous department, unless he could\nget approval from his ex-boss. He had gotten two job offers from the consumer products division. He phoned his ex-boss from the United States. \"You should reject this offer and find your spot here with the semiconductor division,\" the ex-boss said. My student hung up depressed. If he wanted to advance in the company, he had to obey his former superior. He rejected the two offers and prepared to return to the semiconductor side. Then he contacted a friend who was a senior manager in the human resources department to check on the company's regulations. He found there was no rule that he had to stay within his division, but he did need his ex-boss's blessing to switch. He phoned his ex-boss again. This time he asked questions to draw him out. \"Is there any reason you want me to go to the semiconductor headquarters?\" he asked. \"It's the best position for you,\" the ex-boss said. \"The best position?\" he asked. \"It sounds like there's no regulation that I have to remain with the semiconductor division,\" he said. \"Hmm,\" the ex-boss said. \"I don't think there is any.\"\n\"Then will you please tell me what made you decide that I remain in the semiconductor headquarters?\" he asked. The ex-boss said he needed someone to help him network at\nheadquarters between the semiconductor and consumer products divisions. \"So it sounds like you could approve my new position no matter which division, as long as I was in headquarters and could help you communicate better with the top managers.\"\n\"That's right,\" he said. \"I must admit I need your help in headquarters.\"\nMy student realized he had made a breakthrough. Not only had his ex-boss uttered those sweet words-\"that's right\"-but he had revealed his true motive: he needed an ally in headquarters. \"Is there any other help you need?\" he asked. \"Let me tell you everything,\" the ex-boss responded. It turns out his former superior would be up for a promotion to vice president in two years. He desperately wanted to move up into this job. He needed someone in headquarters to lobby the company CEO. \"I would help you in any way,\" my student said. \"But I could help with the networking and also talk you up to the CEO even if I were at headquarters with the consumer products division, right?\"\n\"That's right,\" he said. \"If you get an offer from the consumer products unit, I will approve it.\"\nBingo! By asking questions that got him to \"that's right,\" my student had achieved his goal. He also got his boss to reveal two \"Black Swans,\" the unspoken, underlying breakthrough dynamics of a negotiation (explored in more detail in Chapter 10):\nHis boss needed someone to help him network and communicate in headquarters. His boss would be up for a promotion and needed someone to talk him up to the CEO. My student was able to win the job he desired on the consumer electronics division. And he's been talking up his former boss. \"I was stunned,\" he wrote me in an email. \"In this culture it is not really possible to know what a superior is thinking.\"\nI have many opportunities to travel the country and speak to business leaders, either in formal speaking engagements or private counseling sessions. I entertain them with war stories, then I describe some basic negotiating skills. I always impart a few techniques. Getting to \"that's right\" is a staple. After a speech in Los Angeles, one of the attendees, Emily, sent me an email:\nHi Chris, I feel compelled to tell you that I just tried the \"That's right\" technique in a price negotiation with a potential new client. And, I got what I wanted. I'm so excited!",

Instead, I believe I correctly assessed her motivations, presented her with the right statement to get to a \"that's right\" (in her mind) . . . and then she proposed the solution I wanted and asked if I would agree to it! So, I did of course. Thank you! And I thought to myself: That's right. KEY LESSONS\n\"Sleeping in the same bed and dreaming different dreams\" is an old Chinese expression that describes the intimacy of partnership (whether in marriage or in business) without the communication necessary to sustain it. Such is the recipe for bad marriages and bad negotiations. With each party having its own set of objectives, its own goals and motivations, the truth is that the conversational niceties-the socially lubricating \"yeses\" and \"you're rights\" that get thrown out fast and furious early in any interaction-are not in any way a substitute for real understanding between you and your partner. The power of getting to that understanding, and not to some simple \"yes,\" is revelatory in the art of negotiation. The moment you've convinced someone that you truly understand her dreams and feelings (the whole world that she inhabits), mental and behavioral change becomes possible, and the foundation for a breakthrough has been laid. Use these lessons to lay that foundation:\nCreating unconditional positive regard opens the door to changing thoughts and behaviors. Humans have an innate urge toward socially constructive behavior. The more a person feels understood, and positively affirmed in that understanding, the more likely that urge for constructive behavior will take hold. \"That's right\" is better than \"yes.\" Strive for it. Reaching \"that's right\" in a negotiation creates breakthroughs. Use a summary to trigger a \"that's right.\" The building blocks of a good summary are a label combined with paraphrasing. Identify, rearticulate, and emotionally affirm \"the world according to . . .\"",

      "text": "BEND THEIR REALITY\nne Monday morning in Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, a call came in to the FBI office from the nephew of a prominent Haitian political figure. He spoke so fast he had to repeat his story three times before I understood. But finally I got the basics: kidnappers had snatched his aunt from her car, and their ransom demand was $150,000. \"Give us the money,\" the kidnappers told him, \"or your aunt is going to die.\"\nIn the lawless, chaotic wake of the 2004 rebellion that toppled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti surpassed Colombia as the kidnap capital of the Americas. In fact, with between eight and ten people abducted every day in the Caribbean nation of eight million, Haiti earned the dubious honor of having the highest kidnapping rate in the world. During this onslaught of abductions and death threats, I was the FBI's lead international kidnapping negotiator. And I had never seen anything like it. Reports of abductions-increasingly bold, daylight attacks right in Port-au-Prince-seemed to roll into the office hourly: fourteen students abducted on their school bus; American missionary Phillip Snyder shot in an ambush and seized along with a Haitian boy\nhe was taking to Michigan for eye surgery; prominent Haitian politicians and businessmen bundled from their homes in broad daylight. No one was spared. Most of the abductions went down the same way: ski-mask-clad kidnappers surrounded a house or a car, forced entry with a gun, and snatched a vulnerable victim-usually a woman, child, or elderly person. Early on, there was the possibility that the kidnappings were driven by politically aligned gangs seeking to destabilize Haiti's new government. This proved to be wrong. Haitian criminals are famous for employing brutal means for political ends, but when it came to kidnappings, it was almost always all business. Later on, I'll get to how we pieced together the clues to discover who the perpetrators were and what they really wanted-invaluable information when it came to negotiating with and destabilizing these gangs. But first I want to discuss the crystallizing feature of high-stakes, life-and-death negotiating: that is, how little of it is on the surface. When that Monday ransom call came in to the politician's nephew, the guy was so petrified he could only think of doing one thing: paying the thugs. His reaction makes sense: when you get a call from brutal criminals who say they'll kill your aunt unless you pay them immediately, it seems impossible to find leverage in the situation. So you pay the ransom and they release your relative, right? Wrong. There's always leverage. Negotiation is never a linear formula: add X to Y to get Z. We all have irrational blind spots, hidden needs, and undeveloped notions. Once you understand that subterranean world of unspoken needs and thoughts, you'll discover a universe of variables that can be leveraged to change your counterpart's needs and expectations. From using some people's fear of deadlines and the mysterious power of odd numbers, to our misunderstood relationship to fairness, there are always ways to bend our counterpart's reality so it conforms to what\nwe ultimately want to give them, not to what they initially think they deserve. DON'T COMPROMISE\nLet's go back to the $150,000 ransom demand. We're always taught to look for the win-win solution, to accommodate, to be reasonable. So what's the win-win here? What's the compromise? The traditional negotiating logic that's drilled into us from an early age, the kind that exalts compromises, says, \"Let's just split the difference and offer them $75,000. Then everyone's happy.\"\nNo. Just, simply, no. The win-win mindset pushed by so many negotiation experts is usually ineffective and often disastrous. At best, it satisfies neither side. And if you employ it with a counterpart who has a win-lose approach, you're setting yourself up to be swindled. Of course, as we've noted previously, you need to keep the cooperative, rapport-building, empathetic approach, the kind that creates a dynamic in which deals can be made. But you have to get rid of that na\u00efvet\u00e9. Because compromise-\"splitting the difference\"-can lead to terrible outcomes. Compromise is often a \"bad deal\" and a key theme we'll hit in this chapter is that \"no deal is better than a bad deal.\"\nEven in a kidnapping? Yes. A bad deal in a kidnapping is where someone pays and no one comes out. To make my point on compromise, let me paint you an example: A woman wants her husband to wear black shoes with his suit. But her husband doesn't want to; he prefers brown shoes. So what do they do? They compromise, they meet halfway. And, you guessed it, he wears one black and one brown shoe. Is this the best outcome? No! In fact, that's the\npossible outcome. Either of the two other outcomes-black or brown-would be better than the compromise. Next time you want to compromise, remind yourself of those mismatched shoes. So why are we so infatuated with the notion of compromise if it often leads to poor results? The real problem with compromise is that it has come to be known as this great concept, in relationships and politics and everything else. Compromise, we are told quite simply, is a sacred moral good. Think back to the ransom demand: Fair is no ransom, and what the nephew wants is to pay nothing. So why is he going to offer $75,000, much less $150,000, for the ransom? There is no validity in the $150,000 request. With any compromise, the nephew ends up with a bizarrely bad result. I'm here to call bullshit on compromise right now. We don't compromise because it's right; we compromise because it is easy and because it saves face. We compromise in order to say that at least we got half the pie. Distilled to its essence, we compromise to be safe. Most people in a negotiation are driven by fear or by the desire to avoid pain. Too few are driven by their actual goals.",

Too few are driven by their actual goals. So don't settle and-here's a simple rule-\nnever split the difference\n. Creative solutions are almost always preceded by some degree of risk, annoyance, confusion, and conflict. Accommodation and compromise produce none of that. You've got to embrace the hard stuff. That's where the great deals are. And that's what great negotiators do. DEADLINES: MAKE TIME YOUR ALLY\nTime is one of the most crucial variables in any negotiation. The simple passing of time and its sharper cousin, the deadline, are the screw that pressures every deal to a conclusion. Whether your deadline is real and absolute or merely a line in the sand, it can trick you into believing that doing a deal now is more\nimportant than getting a good deal. Deadlines regularly make people say and do impulsive things that are against their best interests, because we all have a natural tendency to rush as a deadline approaches. What good negotiators do is force themselves to resist this urge and take advantage of it in others. It's not so easy. Ask yourself: What is it about a deadline that causes pressure and anxiety? The answer is consequences; the perception of the loss we'll incur in the future-\"The deal is off!\" our mind screams at us in some imaginary future scenario-should no resolution be achieved by a certain point in time. When you allow the variable of time to trigger such thinking, you have taken yourself hostage, creating an environment of reactive behaviors and poor choices, where your counterpart can now kick back and let an imaginary deadline, and your reaction to it, do all the work for him. Yes, I used the word \"imaginary.\" In all the years I've been doing work in the private sector, I've made it a point to ask nearly every entrepreneur and executive I've worked with whether, over the course of their entire careers, they have ever been a witness to or a party of a negotiation in which a missed deadline had negative repercussions. Among hundreds of such clients, there's one single, solitary gentleman who gave the question serious consideration and responded affirmatively. Deadlines are often arbitrary, almost always flexible, and hardly ever trigger the consequences we think-or are told-they will. Deadlines are the bogeymen of negotiation, almost exclusively self-inflicted figments of our imagination, unnecessarily unsettling us for no good reason. The mantra we coach our clients on is, \"No deal is better than a bad deal.\" If that mantra can truly be internalized, and clients begin to believe they've got all the time they need to conduct the negotiation right, their patience becomes a formidable weapon. A few weeks after the Haitian kidnapping boom began, we started to notice two patterns. First, Mondays seemed to be especially busy, as if the kidnappers had a particularly strong work ethic and wanted to get\na jump on the week. And, second, the thugs grew increasingly eager to get paid as the weekend approached. At first, this didn't make any sense. But by listening closely to the kidnappers and debriefing the hostages we rescued, we discovered something that should have been obvious: These crimes weren't politically motivated at all. Instead, these guys were garden-variety thugs who wanted to get paid by Friday so they could party through the weekend. Once we understood the pattern and knew the kidnappers' self-imposed deadline, we had two key pieces of information that totally shifted the leverage to our side. First, if we let the pressure build by stalling the negotiations until Thursday or Friday, we could cut the best deal. And, second, because you didn't need anything close to $150,000 to have a good weekend in Haiti, offering a lot, lot less would suffice. How close we were getting to their self-imposed deadline would be indicated by how specific the threats were that they issued. \"Give us the money or your aunt is going to die\" is an early stage threat, as the time isn't specified. Increasing specificity on threats in any type of negotiations indicates getting closer to real consequences at a real specified time. To gauge the level of a particular threat, we'd pay attention to how many of the four questions-What? Who? When? And how?-were addressed. When people issue threats, they consciously or subconsciously create ambiguities and loopholes they fully intend to exploit. As the loopholes started to close as the week progressed, and did so over and over again in similar ways with different kidnappings, the pattern emerged. With this information in hand, I came to expect the kidnappings to be orderly, four-day events. It didn't make the abductions any more pleasant for the victim, but it certainly made them more predictable-and a whole lot cheaper-for the families on the other end. It's not just with hostage negotiations that deadlines can play into\nyour hands. Car dealers are prone to give you the best price near the end of the month, when their transactions are assessed. And corporate salespeople work on a quarterly basis and are most vulnerable as the quarter comes to a close. Now, knowing how negotiators use their counterpart's deadlines to gain leverage would seem to suggest that it's best to keep your own deadlines secret. And that's the advice you'll get from most old-school negotiation experts.",

Car dealers are prone to give you the best price near the end of the month, when their transactions are assessed. And corporate salespeople work on a quarterly basis and are most vulnerable as the quarter comes to a close. Now, knowing how negotiators use their counterpart's deadlines to gain leverage would seem to suggest that it's best to keep your own deadlines secret. And that's the advice you'll get from most old-school negotiation experts. In his bestselling 1980 book,\nYou Can Negotiate Anything\nnegotiation expert Herb Cohen tells the story of his first big business deal, when his company sent him to Japan to negotiate with a supplier. When he arrived, his counterparts asked him how long he was staying, and Cohen said a week. For the next seven days, his hosts proceeded to entertain him with parties, tours, and outings-everything but negotiation. In fact, Cohen's counterparts didn't start serious talks until he was about to leave, and the two sides hammered out the deal's final details in the car to the airport. Cohen landed in the United States with the sinking feeling that he'd been played, and that he had conceded too much under deadline pressure. Would he have told them his deadline in retrospect? No, Cohen says, because it gave them a tool he didn't have: \"They knew my deadline, but I didn't know theirs.\"\nThat mentality is everywhere these days. Seeing a simple rule to follow and assuming that a deadline is a strategic weakness, most negotiators follow Cohen's advice and hide their drop-dead date. Allow me to let you in on a little secret: Cohen, and the herd of negotiation \"experts\" who follow his lead, are wrong. Deadlines cut both ways. Cohen may well have been nervous about what his boss would say if he left Japan without an agreement. But it's also true that Cohen's counterparts wouldn't have won if he'd left without a deal. That's the key: When the negotiation is over for one side, it's over for the other too. In fact, Don A. Moore, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, says that hiding a deadline actually puts the negotiator in the worst possible position. In his research, he's found that hiding your deadlines dramatically increases the risk of an impasse. That's because having a deadline pushes you to speed up your concessions, but the other side, thinking that it has time, will just hold out for more. Imagine if when NBA owners set a lockout deadline during contract negotiations they didn't tell the players' union. They would concede and concede as the deadline approached, inciting the union to keep negotiating past the secret deadline. In that sense, hiding a deadline means you're negotiating with yourself, and you always lose when you do so. Moore discovered that when negotiators tell their counterparts about their deadline, they get better deals. It's true. First, by revealing your cutoff you reduce the risk of impasse. And second, when an opponent knows your deadline, he'll get to the real deal- and concession-making more quickly. I've got one final point to make before we move on: Deadlines are almost never ironclad. What's more important is engaging in the process and having a feel for how long that will take. You may see that you have more to accomplish than time will actually allow before the clock runs out. NO SUCH THING AS FAIR\nIn the third week of my negotiations class, we play my favorite type of game, that is, the kind that shows my students how much they don't understand themselves (I know-I'm cruel). It's called the Ultimatum Game, and it goes like this: After the students split into pairs of a \"proposer\" and an \"accepter,\" I give each\nproposer $10. The proposer then has to offer the accepter a round number of dollars. If the accepter agrees he or she receives what's been offered and the proposer gets the rest. If the accepter refuses the offer, though, they both get nothing and the $10 goes back to me. Whether they \"win\" and keep the money or \"lose\" and have to give it back is irrelevant (except to my wallet). What's important is the offer they make. The truly shocking thing is that, almost without exception, whatever selection anyone makes, they find themselves in a minority. No matter whether they chose $6/$4, $5/$5, $7/$3, $8/$2, etc., they look around and are inevitably surprised to find no split was chosen far more than any other. In something as simple as merely splitting $10 of \"found\" money, there is no consensus of what constitutes a \"fair\" or \"rational\" split. After we run this little experiment, I stand up in front of the class and make a point they don't like to hear: the reasoning each and every student used was 100 percent irrational and emotional. \"What?\" they say. \"I made a rational decision.\"\nThen I lay out how they're wrong. First, how could they all be using reason if so many have made different offers? That's the point: They didn't. They assumed the other guy would reason just like them. \"If you approach a negotiation thinking that the other guy thinks like you, you're wrong,\" I say. \"That's not empathy; that's projection.\"\nAnd then I push it even further: Why, I ask, did none of the proposers offer $1, which is the best rational offer for them and logically unrejectable for the accepter? And if they did and they got rejected-which happens-why did the accepter turn them down? \"Anyone who made any offer other than $1 made an emotional choice\" I say. \"And for you accepters who turned down $1, since when is getting $0 better than getting $1?",

Did the rules of finance suddenly change?\"\nThis rocks my students' view of themselves as rational actors. But they're not. None of us are. We're all irrational, all emotional. Emotion\nis a necessary element to decision making that we ignore at our own peril. Realizing that hits people hard between the eyes. Descartes' Error: Emotion, Reason, and the Human Brain\nneuroscientist Antonio Damasio explained a groundbreaking discovery he made. Studying people who had damage in the part of the brain where emotions are generated, he found that they all had something peculiar in common: They couldn't make decisions. They could describe what they should do in logical terms, but they found it impossible to make even the simplest choice. In other words, while we may use logic to reason ourselves toward a decision, the actual decision\nis governed by emotion. THE F-WORD: WHY IT'S SO POWERFUL, WHEN TO USE IT, AND HOW\nThe most powerful word in negotiations is \"Fair.\" As human beings, we're mightily swayed by how much we feel we have been respected. People comply with agreements if they feel they've been treated fairly and lash out if they don't. A decade of brain-imaging studies has shown that human neural activity, particularly in the emotion-regulating insular cortex, reflects the degree of unfairness in social interactions. Even nonhuman primates are hardwired to reject unfairness. In one famous study, two capuchin monkeys were set to perform the same task, but one was rewarded with sweet grapes while the other received cucumbers. In response to such blatant unfairness, the cucumber-fed monkey literally went bananas. In the Ultimatum Game, years of experience has shown me that most accepters will invariably reject any offer that is less than half of the proposer's money. Once you get to a quarter of the proposer's money you can forget it and the accepters are insulted. Most people\nmake an irrational choice to let the dollar slip through their fingers rather than to accept a derisory offer, because the negative emotional value of unfairness outweighs the positive rational value of the money. This irrational reaction to unfairness extends all the way to serious economic deals. Remember Robin Williams's great work as the voice of the genie in Disney's\n? Because he wanted to leave something wonderful behind for his kids, he said, he did the voice for a cut-rate fee of $75,000, far below his usual $8 million payday. But then something happened: the movie became a huge hit, raking in $504 million. And Williams went ballistic. Now look at this with the Ultimatum Game in mind. Williams wasn't angry because of the money; it was the perceived unfairness that pissed him off. He didn't complain about his contract until\nbecame a blockbuster, and then he and his agent went loud and long about how they got ripped off. Lucky for Williams, Disney wanted to keep its star happy. After initially pointing out the obvious-that he'd happily signed the deal-Disney made the dramatic gesture of sending the star a Picasso painting worth a reported $1 million. The nation of Iran was not so lucky. In recent years, Iran has put up with sanctions that have cost it well over $100 billion in foreign investment and oil revenue in order to defend a uranium-enriching nuclear program that can only meet 2 percent of its energy needs. In other words, like the students who won't take a free $1 because the offer seems insulting, Iran has screwed itself out of its chief source of income-oil and gas revenue-in order to pursue an energy project with little expected payoff. Why? Again, fairness. For Iran, it's not fair that the global powers-which together have several thousand nuclear weapons-should be able to decide if it can use nuclear energy. And why, Iran wonders, is it considered a pariah\nfor enriching uranium when India and Pakistan, which clandestinely acquired nuclear weapons, are accepted members of the international community? In a TV interview, former Iranian nuclear negotiator Seyed Hossein Mousavian hit the nail on the head. \"The nuclear issue today for Iranians is not nuclear,\" he said, \"it's defending their integrity [as an] independent identity against the pressure of the rest.\"\nYou may not trust Iran, but its moves are pretty clear evidence that rejecting perceived unfairness, even at substantial cost, is a powerful motivation. Once you understand what a messy, emotional, and destructive dynamic \"fairness\" can be, you can see why \"Fair\" is a tremendously powerful word that you need to use with care. In fact, of the three ways that people drop this F-bomb, only one is positive. The most common use is a judo-like defensive move that destabilizes the other side. This manipulation usually takes the form of something like, \"We just want what's fair.\"\nThink back to the last time someone made this implicit accusation of unfairness to you, and I bet you'll have to admit that it immediately triggered feelings of defensiveness and discomfort. These feelings are often subconscious and often lead to an irrational concession. A friend of mine was selling her Boston home in a bust market a few years back. The offer she got was much lower than she wanted-it meant a big loss for her-and out of frustration she dropped this F-bomb on the prospective buyer. \"We just want what's fair,\" she said. Emotionally rattled by the implicit accusation, the guy raised his offer immediately.",

Emotionally rattled by the implicit accusation, the guy raised his offer immediately. If you're on the business end of this accusation, you need to realize that the other side might not be trying to pick your pocket; like\nmy friend, they might just be overwhelmed by circumstance. The best response either way is to take a deep breath and restrain your desire to concede. Then say, \"Okay, I apologize. Let's stop everything and go back to where I started treating you unfairly and we'll fix it.\"\nThe second use of the F-bomb is more nefarious. In this one, your counterpart will basically accuse you of being dense or dishonest by saying, \"We've given you a fair offer.\" It's a terrible little jab meant to distract your attention and manipulate you into giving in. Whenever someone tries this on me, I think back to the last NFL lockout. Negotiations were getting down to the wire and the NFL Players Association (NFLPA) said that before they agreed to a final deal they wanted the owners to open their books. The owners' answer? \"We've given the players a fair offer.\"\nNotice the horrible genius of this: instead of opening their books or declining to do so, the owners shifted the focus to the NFLPA's supposed lack of understanding of fairness. If you find yourself in this situation, the best reaction is to simply mirror the \"F\" that has just been lobbed at you. \"Fair?\" you'd respond, pausing to let the word's power do to them as it was intended to do to you. Follow that with a label: \"It seems like you're ready to provide the evidence that supports that,\" which alludes to opening their books or otherwise handing over information that will either contradict their claim to fairness or give you more data to work with than you had previously. Right away, you declaw the attack. The last use of the F-word is my favorite because it's positive and constructive. It sets the stage for honest and empathetic negotiation. Here's how I use it: Early on in a negotiation, I say, \"I want you to feel like you are being treated fairly at all times. So please stop me at any time if you feel I'm being unfair, and we'll address it.\"\nIt's simple and clear and sets me up as an honest dealer. With that statement, I let people know it is okay to use that word with me if they\nuse it honestly. As a negotiator, you should strive for a reputation of being fair. Your reputation precedes you. Let it precede you in a way that paves success. HOW TO DISCOVER THE EMOTIONAL DRIVERS BEHIND WHAT THE OTHER PARTY VALUES\nA few years ago, I stumbled upon the book\nHow to Become a Rainmaker\nand I like to review it occasionally to refresh my sense of the emotional drivers that fuel decisions. The book does a great job to explain the sales job not as a rational argument, but as an emotional framing job. If you can get the other party to reveal their problems, pain, and unmet objectives-if you can get at what people are\nbuying-then you can sell them a vision of their problem that leaves your proposal as the perfect solution. Look at this from the most basic level. What does a good babysitter sell, really? It's not child care exactly, but a relaxed evening. A furnace salesperson? Cozy rooms for family time. A locksmith? A feeling of security. Know the emotional drivers and you can frame the benefits of any deal in language that will resonate. BEND THEIR REALITY\nTake the same person, change one or two variables, and $100 can be a glorious victory or a vicious insult. Recognizing this phenomenon lets you bend reality from insult to victory. Let me give you an example. I have this coffee mug, red and white with the Swiss flag. No chips, but used. What would you pay for it, deep down in your heart of hearts? You're probably going to say something like $3.50. Let's say it's your mug now. You're going to sell it to me. So tell me what it's worth. You're probably going to say something between $5 and $7. In both cases, it was the exact same mug. All I did was move the mug in relation to you, and I totally changed its value. Or imagine that I offer you $20 to run a three-minute errand and get me a cup of coffee. You're going to think to yourself that $20 for three minutes is $400 an hour. You're going to be thrilled. What if then you find out that by getting you to run that errand I made a million dollars. You'd go from being ecstatic for making $400 an hour to being angry because you got ripped off. The value of the $20, just like the value of the coffee mug, didn't change. But your perspective of it did. Just by how I position the $20, I can make you happy or disgusted by it. I tell you that not to expose our decision making as emotional and irrational. We've already seen that. What I am saying is that while our decisions may be largely irrational, that doesn't mean there aren't consistent patterns, principles, and rules behind how we act. And once you know those mental patterns, you start to see ways to influence them.",

What I am saying is that while our decisions may be largely irrational, that doesn't mean there aren't consistent patterns, principles, and rules behind how we act. And once you know those mental patterns, you start to see ways to influence them. By far the best theory for describing the principles of our irrational decisions is something called\nProspect Theory\n. Created in 1979 by the psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, prospect theory describes how people choose between options that involve risk, like in a negotiation. The theory argues that people are drawn to sure things over probabilities, even when the probability is a better choice. That's called the\nCertainty Effect\n. And people will take greater risks to avoid losses than to achieve gains. That's called\nLoss Aversion\nThat's why people who statistically have no need for insurance buy it. Or consider this: a person who's told he has a 95 percent chance of receiving $10,000 or a 100 percent chance of getting $9,499 will usually\navoid risk and take the 100 percent certain safe choice, while the same person who's told he has a 95 percent chance of losing $10,000 or a 100 percent chance of losing $9,499 will make the opposite choice, risking the bigger 95 percent option to avoid the loss. The chance for loss incites more risk than the possibility of an equal gain. Over the next few pages I'll explain a few prospect theory tactics you can use to your advantage. But first let me leave you with a crucial lesson about loss aversion: In a tough negotiation, it's not enough to show the other party that you can deliver the thing they want. To get real leverage, you have to persuade them that they have something concrete to lose if the deal falls through. 1. ANCHOR THEIR EMOTIONS\nTo bend your counterpart's reality, you have to start with the basics of empathy. So start out with an accusation audit acknowledging all of their fears. By anchoring their emotions in preparation for a loss, you inflame the other side's loss aversion so that they'll jump at the chance to avoid it. On my first consulting project after leaving the FBI, I received the honor to train the national hostage negotiation team for the United Arab Emirates. Unfortunately, the prestige of the assignment was tempered during the project by problems with the general contractor (I was a subcontractor). The problems became so bad that I was going to have to go back to the contractors I'd signed up, who normally got $2,000 a day, and tell them that for several months, I could only offer $500. I knew exactly what they would do if I just told them straight out: they'd laugh me out of town. So I got each of them on the phone and hit them hard with an accusation audit. \"I got a lousy proposition for you,\" I said, and paused until each asked me to go on. \"By the time we get off the phone, you're going to think I'm a lousy businessman. You're going to think I can't budget or\nplan. You're going to think Chris Voss is a big talker. His first big project ever out of the FBI, he screws it up completely. He doesn't know how to run an operation. And he might even have lied to me.\"\nAnd then, once I'd anchored their emotions in a minefield of low expectations, I played on their loss aversion. \"Still, I wanted to bring this opportunity to you before I took it to someone else,\" I said. Suddenly, their call wasn't about being cut from $2,000 to $500 but how not to lose $500 to some other guy. Every single one of them took the deal. No counteroffers, no complaints. Now, if I hadn't anchored their emotions low, their perception of $500 would have been totally different. If I'd just called and said, \"I can give you $500 per day. What do you think?\" they'd have taken it as an insult and slammed down the phone. 2. LET THE OTHER GUY GO FIRST . . . MOST OF THE TIME. Now, it's clear that the benefits of anchoring emotions are great when it comes to bending your counterpart's reality. But going first is not necessarily the best thing when it comes to negotiating price. When the famous film director Billy Wilder went to hire the famous detective novelist Raymond Chandler to write the 1944 classic\nDouble Indemnity\n, Chandler was new to Hollywood. But he came ready to negotiate, and in his meeting with Wilder and the movie's producer, Chandler made the first salary offer: he bluffly demanded $150 per week and warned Wilder that it might take him three weeks to finish the project. Wilder and the producer could barely stop from laughing, because they had been planning to pay Chandler $750 per week and they knew that movie scripts took months to write. Lucky for Chandler, Wilder and the producer valued their relationship with Chandler more than a few hundred dollars, so they took pity on him and called an agent to represent Chandler in the negotiations. Similarly, I had a student named Jerry who royally screwed up his salary negotiation by going first (let me say that this happened before he was my student). In an interview at a New York financial firm, he demanded $110,000, in large part because it represented a 30 percent raise. It was only after he started that he realized that the firm had started everybody else in his program at $125,000.",

It was only after he started that he realized that the firm had started everybody else in his program at $125,000. That's why I suggest you let the other side anchor monetary negotiations. The real issue is that neither side has perfect information going to the table. This often means you don't know enough to open with confidence. That's especially true anytime you don't know the market value of what you are buying or selling, like with Jerry or Chandler. By letting them anchor you also might get lucky: I've experienced many negotiations when the other party's first offer was higher than the\nfigure I had in mind. If I'd gone first they would have agreed and I would have left with either the winner's curse or buyer's remorse, those gut-wrenching feelings that you've overpaid or undersold. That said, you've got to be careful when you let the other guy anchor. You have to prepare yourself psychically to withstand the first offer. If the other guy's a pro, a shark, he's going to go for an extreme anchor in order to bend\nreality. Then, when they come back with a merely absurd offer it will seem reasonable, just like an expensive $400 iPhone seems reasonable after they mark it down from a crazy $600. The tendency to be anchored by extreme numbers is a psychological quirk known as the \"anchor and adjustment\" effect. Researchers have discovered that we tend to make adjustments from our first reference points. For example, most people glimpsing 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 estimate that it yields a higher result than the same string in reverse order. That's because we focus on the first numbers and extrapolate. That's not to say, \"Never open.\" Rules like that are easy to remember, but, like most simplistic approaches, they are not always good advice. If you're dealing with a rookie counterpart, you might be tempted to be the shark and throw out an extreme anchor. Or if you really know the market and you're dealing with an equally informed pro, you might offer a number just to make the negotiation go faster. Here's my personal advice on whether or not you want to be the shark that eats a rookie counterpart. Just remember, your reputation precedes you. I've run into CEOs whose reputation was to always badly beat their counterpart and pretty soon no one would deal with them. 3. ESTABLISH A RANGE\nWhile going first rarely helps, there is one way to\nto make an offer and bend their reality in the process. That is, by alluding to a range. What I mean is this: When confronted with naming your terms or price, counter by recalling a similar deal which establishes your \"ballpark,\" albeit the best possible ballpark you wish to be in. Instead of saying, \"I'm worth $110,000,\" Jerry might have said, \"At top places like X Corp., people in this job get between $130,000 and $170,000.\"\nThat gets your point across without moving the other party into a defensive position. And it gets him thinking at higher levels. Research shows that people who hear extreme anchors unconsciously adjust their expectations in the direction of the opening number. Many even go directly to their price limit. If Jerry had given this range, the firm probably would have offered $130,000 because it looked so cheap next to $170,000. In a recent study,\nColumbia Business School psychologists found that job applicants who named a range received significantly higher overall salaries than those who offered a number, especially if their range was a \"bolstering range,\" in which the low number in the range was what they actually wanted. Understand, if you offer a range (and it's a good idea to do so) expect them to come in at the low end. 4. PIVOT TO NONMONETARY TERMS\nPeople get hung up on \"How much?\" But don't deal with numbers in isolation. That leads to bargaining, a series of rigid positions defined by emotional views of fairness and pride. Negotiation is a more intricate and subtle dynamic than that. One of the easiest ways to bend your counterpart's reality to your point of view is by pivoting to nonmonetary terms. After you've anchored them high, you can make your offer seem reasonable by offering things that aren't important to you but could be important to them. Or if their offer is low you could ask for things that matter more to you than them. Since this is sometimes difficult, what we often do is throw out examples to start the brainstorming process. Not long ago I did some training for the Memphis Bar Association. Normally, for the training they were looking for, I'd charge $25,000 a day. They came in with a much lower offer that I balked at. They then offered to do a cover story about me in their association magazine. For me to be on the cover of a magazine that went out to who knows how many of the country's top lawyers was priceless advertising. (Plus my mom is really proud of it!)\nThey had to put something on the cover anyway, so it had zero cost to them and I gave them a steep discount on my fee. I constantly use that as an example in my negotiations now when I name a price.",

WHEN YOU DO TALK NUMBERS, USE ODD ONES\nEvery number has a psychological significance that goes beyond its value. And I'm not just talking about how you love 17 because you\nthink it's lucky. What I mean is that, in terms of negotiation, some numbers appear more immovable than others. The biggest thing to remember is that numbers that end in 0 inevitably feel like temporary placeholders, guesstimates that you can easily be negotiated off of. But anything you throw out that sounds less rounded-say, $37,263-feels like a figure that you came to as a result of thoughtful calculation. Such numbers feel serious and permanent to your counterpart, so use them to fortify your offers. 6. SURPRISE WITH A GIFT\nYou can get your counterpart into a mood of generosity by staking an extreme anchor and then, after their inevitable first rejection, offering them a wholly unrelated surprise gift. Unexpected conciliatory gestures like this are hugely effective because they introduce a dynamic called reciprocity; the other party feels the need to answer your generosity in kind. They will suddenly come up on their offer, or they'll look to repay your kindness in the future. People feel obliged to repay debts of kindness. Let's look at it in terms of international politics. In 1977 Egyptian president Anwar Sadat dramatically pushed negotiations on the Egypt-Israel peace treaty forward by making a surprise address to the Israeli Knesset, a generous gesture that did not involve making any actual concessions but did signify a big step toward peace. Back in Haiti, a few hours after the kidnappers had snatched his aunt, I was on the phone with the politician's nephew. There was no way their family could come up with $150,000, he told me, but they could pay between $50,000 and $85,000. But since learning that the ransom was just party money, I was aiming much lower: $5,000. We were not going to compromise. It was a matter of professional pride. I advised him to start off by anchoring the conversation in the idea that he didn't have the money, but to do so without saying \"No\" so as not to hit their pride head-on. \"How am I supposed to do that?\" he asked in the next call. The kidnapper made another general threat against the aunt and again demanded the cash. That's when I had the nephew subtly question the kidnapper's fairness. \"I'm sorry,\" the nephew responded, \"but how are we supposed to pay if you're going to hurt her?\"\nThat brought up the aunt's death, which was the thing the kidnappers most wanted to avoid. They needed to keep her unharmed if they hoped to get any money. They were commodity traders, after all. Notice that to this point the nephew hadn't named a price. This game of attrition finally pushed the kidnappers to name a number first. Without prodding, they dropped to $50,000. Now that the kidnappers' reality had been bent to a smaller number, my colleagues and I told the nephew to stand his ground. \"How can I come up with that kind of money?\" we told him to ask. Again, the kidnapper dropped his demand, to $25,000. Now that we had him in our sights, we had the nephew make his first offer, an extreme low anchor of $3,000. The line went silent and the nephew began to sweat profusely, but we told him to hold tight. This always happened at the moment the kidnapper's economic reality got totally rearranged. When he spoke again, the kidnapper seemed shell-shocked. But he went on. His next offer was lower, $10,000. Then we had the nephew answer with a strange number that seemed to come from deep calculation of what his aunt's life was worth: $4,751. His new price? $7,500. In response, we had the cousin \"spontaneously\" say he'd throw in a new portable CD stereo and repeated the $4,751. The kidnappers, who didn't really want the CD stereo felt there was no more money to be had, said yes. Six hours later, the family paid that sum and the aunt came back home safely. HOW TO NEGOTIATE A BETTER SALARY\nOne of the critical factors in business school rankings is how well their graduates are compensated. So I tell every MBA class I lecture that my first objective is to single-handedly raise the ranking of their school by teaching them how to negotiate a better salary. I break down the process into three parts that blend this chapter's dynamics in a way that not only brings you better money, but convinces your boss to fight to get it for you. BE PLEASANTLY PERSISTENT ON NONSALARY TERMS\nPleasant persistence is a kind of emotional anchoring that creates empathy with the boss and builds the right psychological environment for constructive discussion. And the more you talk about nonsalary terms, the more likely you are to hear the full range of their options. If they can't meet your nonsalary requests, they may even counter with more money, like they did with a French-born American former student of mine. She kept asking-with a big smile-for an extra week of vacation beyond what the company normally gave. She was \"French,\" she said, and that's what French people did.",

She kept asking-with a big smile-for an extra week of vacation beyond what the company normally gave. She was \"French,\" she said, and that's what French people did. The hiring company was completely handcuffed on the vacation issue, but because she was so darned delightful, and because she introduced a nonmonetary variable into the notion of her value, they countered by increasing her salary offer. SALARY TERMS WITHOUT SUCCESS TERMS IS RUSSIAN ROULETTE\nOnce you've negotiated a salary, make sure to define success for your position-as well as metrics for your next raise. That's meaningful for you and free for your boss, much like giving me a magazine cover\nstory was for the bar association. It gets you a planned raise and, by defining your success in relation to your boss's supervision, it leads into the next step . . . SPARK THEIR INTEREST IN YOUR SUCCESS AND GAIN AN UNOFFICIAL MENTOR\nRemember the idea of figuring what the other side is\nbuying? Well, when you are selling yourself to a manager, sell yourself as more than a body for a job; sell yourself, and your success, as a way they can validate their own intelligence and broadcast it to the rest of the company. Make sure they know you'll act as a flesh-and-blood argument for their importance. Once you've bent their reality to include you as their ambassador, they'll have a stake in your success. Ask: \"What does it take to be successful here?\"\nPlease notice that this question is similar to questions that are suggested by many MBA career counseling centers, yet not\nthe same. And it's the exact wording of this question that's critical. Students from my MBA courses who have asked this question in job interviews have actually had interviewers lean forward and say, \"No one ever asked us that before.\" The interviewer then gave a great and detailed answer. The key issue here is if someone gives you guidance, they will watch to see if you follow their advice. They will have a personal stake in seeing you succeed. You've just recruited your first unofficial mentor. To show how this can be done to near perfection, I can think of no better example than my former MBA student Angel Prado. While Angel was finishing up his MBA, he went to his boss and began to lay the groundwork for his work post-MBA (which the company was paying). During his last semester, he set a nonspecific anchor-a kind of range-by suggesting to his boss that once he\ngraduated and the company was done investing in his MBA (around $31,000 per year), that money should go to him as salary. His boss made no commitment, but Angel was pleasantly persistent about it, which set the idea as an anchor in his boss's mind. Upon graduation, Angel and his boss had their big sit-down. In an assertive and calm manner, Angel broached a nonfinancial issue to move the focus away from \"How much?\": he asked for a new title. Angel's boss readily agreed that a new role was a no-brainer after Angel's new degree. At that point, Angel and his manager defined what his roles and responsibilities would be in his new role, thereby setting success metrics. Then Angel took a breath and paused so that his boss would be the first to throw out a number. At last, he did. Curiously enough, the number showed that Angel's earlier efforts at anchoring had worked: he proposed to add $31,000 to Angel's base salary, almost a 50 percent raise. But Angel was no rookie negotiator, not after taking my class. So instead of countering and getting stuck in \"How much?\" he kept talking, labeling the boss's emotions and empathizing with his situation (at the time the company was going through difficult negotiations with its investors). And then Angel courteously asked for a moment to step away and print up the agreed-upon job description. This pause created a dynamic of pre-deadline urgency in his boss, which Angel exploited when he returned with the printout. On the bottom, he'd added his desired compensation: \"$134.5k-$143k.\"\nIn that one little move, Angel weaved together a bunch of the lessons from this chapter. The odd numbers gave them the weight of thoughtful calculation. The numbers were high too, which exploited his boss's natural tendency to go directly to his price limit when faced by an extreme anchor. And they were a range, which made Angel seem less aggressive and the lower end more reasonable in comparison. From his boss's body language-raised eyebrows-it was clear that he was surprised by the compensation request. But it had the desired effect: after some comments about the description, he countered with $120,000. Angel didn't say \"No\" or \"Yes,\" but kept talking and creating empathy. Then, in the middle of a sentence, seemingly out of the blue, his boss threw out $127,000. With his boss obviously negotiating with himself, Angel kept him going. Finally his boss said he agreed with the $134,500 and would pay that salary starting in three months, contingent on the board of directors' approval. As the icing on the cake, Angel worked in a positive use of the word \"Fair\" (\"That's fair,\" he said), and then sold the raise to his boss as a marriage in which his boss would be the mentor. \"I'm asking you, not the board, for the promotion, and all I need is for you to agree with it,\" he said. And how did Angel's boss reply to his new ambassador?",

KEY LESSONS\nCompared to the tools discussed in previous chapters, the techniques here seem concrete and easy to use. But many people shy away from them because they seem manipulative. Something that bends your counterpart's reality must be cheating, right? In response, let me just say that these tools are used by all the best negotiators because they simply recognize the human psyche as it is. We are emotional, irrational beasts who are emotional and irrational in predictable, pattern-filled ways. Using that knowledge is only, well, rational. As you work these tools into your daily life, remember the following powerful lessons:\nAll negotiations are defined by a network of subterranean desires and needs. Don't let yourself be fooled by the surface. Once you know that the Haitian kidnappers just want party money, you will be miles better prepared. Splitting the difference is wearing one black and one brown shoe, so don't compromise. Meeting halfway often leads to bad deals for both sides. Approaching deadlines entice people to rush the negotiating process and do impulsive things that are against their best interests. The F-word-\"Fair\"-is an emotional term people usually exploit to put the other side on the defensive and gain concessions. When your counterpart drops the F-bomb, don't get suckered into a concession. Instead, ask them to explain how you're mistreating them. You can bend your counterpart's reality by anchoring his starting point. Before you make an offer, emotionally anchor them by saying how bad it will be. When you get to numbers, set an extreme anchor to make your \"real\" offer seem reasonable, or use a range to seem less aggressive. The real value of anything depends on what vantage point you're looking at it from. People will take more risks to avoid a loss than to realize a gain. Make sure your counterpart sees that there is something to lose by inaction.",

      "text": "CREATE THE ILLUSION OF CONTROL\nmonth after I'd finished working the case of Jeffrey Schilling in May 2001, I got orders from headquarters to head back to Manila. The same bad guys who'd taken Schilling, a brutal group of radical Islamists named the Abu Sayyaf, had raided the Dos Palmas private diving resort and taken twenty hostages, including three Americans: Martin and Gracia Burnham, a missionary couple from Wichita, Kansas; and Guillermo Sobero, a guy who ran a California waterproofing firm. Dos Palmas was a negotiator's nightmare from the start. The day after the kidnappings, the recently elected Philippine president, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, set up the most confrontational, nonconstructive dynamic possible by publicly declaring \"all-out war\" on the Abu Sayyaf. Not exactly empathetic discourse, right? It got a lot worse. The Philippine army and marines had a turf war in the midst of the negotiations, pissing off the kidnappers with several botched raids. Because American hostages were involved, the CIA, the FBI, and U.S. military intelligence were all called in and we too squabbled among ourselves. Then the kidnappers raped and killed several hostages, 9/11 happened, and the Abu Sayyaf was linked to Al Qaeda. By the time the crisis concluded in an orgy of gunshots in June 2002, Dos Palmas had officially become the biggest failure in my professional life. To call it a train wreck would be generous, if you know what I mean. But failures plant the seeds of future success, and our failure in the Philippines was no exception. If the Dos Palmas calamity showed me anything, it was that we all were still suffering under the notion that negotiation was a wrestling match where the point is to exhaust your opponent into submission, hope for the best, and never back down. As my disappointment with Dos Palmas forced me to reckon with our failed techniques, I took a deep look into the newest negotiating theories-some great and some completely harebrained-and I had a chance encounter with a case in Pittsburgh that completely changed how I looked at the interpersonal dynamics of negotiation conversations. From the ashes of Dos Palmas, then, we learned a lesson that would forever change how the FBI negotiated kidnappings. We learned that negotiation was coaxing, not overcoming; co-opting, not defeating. Most important, we learned that successful negotiation involved getting your counterpart to do the work for you and suggest your solution himself. It involved giving him the illusion of control while you, in fact, were the one defining the conversation. The tool we developed is something I call the calibrated, or open-ended, question. What it does is remove aggression from conversations by acknowledging the other side openly, without resistance. In doing so, it lets you introduce ideas and requests without sounding pushy. It allows you to nudge. I'll explain it in depth later on, but for now let me say that it's really as simple as removing the hostility from the statement \"You can't leave\" and turning it into a question. \"What do you hope to achieve by going?\"\nDON'T TRY TO NEGOTIATE IN A FIREFIGHT\nThe moment I arrived in Manila on the Burnham-Sobero case I was sent down to the Mindanao region, where the Philippine military was lobbing bullets and rockets into a hospital complex where the Abu Sayyaf and the hostages were holed up. This was no place for a negotiator, because it's impossible to have a dialogue in the middle of a firefight. Then things got worse: when I woke up the next morning, I learned that during the night the kidnappers had taken their hostages and escaped. The \"escape\" was the first sign that this operation was going to be a rolling train wreck and that the Philippine military was less than a trustworthy partner. During debriefings following the episode, it was revealed that during a cease-fire a military guy had collected a suitcase from the thugs in the hospital, and not long after that all the soldiers on the rear perimeter of the hospital had been called away for a \"meeting.\" Coincidentally-or not-the bad guys chose that moment to slip away. Things really blew up two weeks later, on the Philippines' Independence Day, when Abu Sabaya announced that he was going to behead \"one of the whites\" unless the government called off its manhunt by midday. We knew this meant one of the Americans and anticipated it would be Guillermo Sobero. We didn't have any direct contact with the kidnappers at the time because our partners in the Philippine military had assigned us an intermediary who always \"forgot\" to make sure we were present for his phone calls with the kidnappers (and similarly \"forgot\" to tape them). All we could do was send text messages offering to schedule a time to speak. What ended up happening was that just before the noon deadline, Sabaya and a member of the Philippine presidential cabinet had a conversation on a radio talk show, and the government conceded to\nSabaya's demand to name a Malaysian senator as a negotiator. In exchange, Sabaya agreed not to kill a hostage. But it was too late to fix this atmosphere of confrontation, distrust, and lies. That afternoon, the hostages heard Sabaya on the phone yelling, \"But that was part of the agreement! That was a part of the agreement!\" Not long after, the Abu Sayyaf beheaded Guillermo Sobero and for good measure the group took fifteen more hostages. With none of the important moving parts anywhere near under our control and the United States largely uninterested in spite of Sobero's murder, I headed back to Washington, D.C. It seemed like there was little we could do. Then 9/11 changed everything. Once a minor terrorist outfit, the Abu Sayyaf was suddenly linked to Al Qaeda. And then a Philippine TV reporter named Arlyn dela Cruz got into the Abu Sayyaf camp and videotaped Sabaya as he taunted the American missionaries Martin and Gracia Burnham, who were so emaciated they looked like concentration camp survivors.",

And then a Philippine TV reporter named Arlyn dela Cruz got into the Abu Sayyaf camp and videotaped Sabaya as he taunted the American missionaries Martin and Gracia Burnham, who were so emaciated they looked like concentration camp survivors. The video hit the U.S. news media like thunder. Suddenly, the case became a major U.S. government priority. THERE IS ALWAYS A TEAM ON THE OTHER SIDE\nThe FBI sent me back in. Now I was sent in to make sure a deal got made. It was all very high profile, too. Some of my contacts reported that FBI director Robert Mueller was personally briefing President George W. Bush every morning on what we were doing. When Director Mueller showed up in the U.S. Embassy in Manila and I was introduced to him, a look of recognition came over his face. That was a very heady moment. But all the support in the world won't work if your counterpart's team is dysfunctional. If your negotiation efforts don't reach past your\ncounterpart and into the team behind him, then you've got a \"hope\"-based deal-and hope is not a strategy. One of the things I failed to fully appreciate then was that the kidnappers had changed negotiators themselves. Sabaya had been replaced. My boss Gary Noesner had, in a previous kidnapping, pointed out to me that a change in negotiators by the other side almost always signaled that they meant to take a harder line. What I didn't realize at the time was this meant Sabaya was going to play a role as a deal breaker if he wasn't accounted for. Our new tack was to buy the Burnhams back. Although the United States officially doesn't pay ransoms, a donor had been found who would provide $300,000. The new Abu Sayyaf negotiator agreed to a release. The ransom drop was a disaster. The kidnappers decided that they wouldn't release the Burnhams: or, rather, Sabaya, who was physically in charge of the hostages, refused to release them. He had cut his own side-deal-one we didn't know about-and it had fallen through. The new negotiator, now embarrassed and in a foul mood, covered himself by claiming that the payment was short $600. We were baffled-\"Six hundred dollars? You won't let hostages go because of six hundred dollars?\"-and we tried to argue that if the money was missing, it must have been the courier who had stolen the money. But we had no dynamic of trust and cooperation to back us up. The $300,000 was gone and we were back to rarely answered text messages. The slow-motion wreck culminated about two months later with a botched \"rescue.\" A team of Philippine Scout Rangers walking around in the woods came across the Abu Sayyaf camp, or so they said. Later we heard another government agency had tipped them off. That other government agency (OGA) had not told us about their location because . . . because . . . why? That's something I will never understand. The Scout Rangers formed a skirmish line from a tree line above the camp and opened fire, indiscriminately pouring bullets into the area. Gracia and Martin were taking a nap in their hammocks when the fire started raining down. They both fell out of their hammocks and started to roll down the hill toward safety. But as a sheet of bullets from their rescuers fell on them, Gracia felt a searing burn flare through her right thigh. And then, she felt Martin go limp. Minutes later, after the last rebels fled, the squad of Philippine soldiers tried to reassure Gracia that her husband was fine, but she shook her head. After a year in captivity, she had no time for fantasies. Gracia knew her husband was dead, and she was right: he'd been hit in the chest, three times, by \"friendly\" fire. In the end, the supposed rescue mission killed two of the three hostages there that day (a Philippine nurse named Ediborah Yap also died), and the big fish-Sabaya-escaped to live a few more months. From beginning to end, the thirteen-month mission was a complete failure, a waste of lives and treasure. As I sat in the dark at home a few days later, dispirited and spent, I knew that something had to change. We couldn't let this happen again. If the hostages' deaths were going to mean something, we would have to find a new way to negotiate, communicate, listen, and speak, both with our enemies and with our friends. Not for communication's sake, though. No. We had to do it to\nAVOID A SHOWDOWN\nNo two ways about it, my return to the United States was a time of reckoning. I questioned-I even doubted-some of what we were doing at the FBI. If what we knew wasn't enough, we had to get better. The real kick in the pants came after my return, when I was reviewing information about the case, a lot of which we hadn't had in the field. Among the piles of information was one fact that totally blew my mind. Martin Burnham had been overheard on a phone call to\nI wondered what in God's name our hostage was doing talking on the phone without us knowing. And with whom was he talking?

Martin Burnham had been overheard on a phone call to I wondered what in God's name our hostage was doing talking on the phone without us knowing. And with whom was he talking? There's only one reason a hostage ever gets on a phone. It's to provide proof of life. Someone else had been trying to ransom the Burnhams out. It turned out to be someone working for a crooked Philippine politician who'd been running a parallel negotiation for the Burnhams' release. He wanted to buy the hostages out himself in order to show up Philippine president Arroyo. But it wasn't so much that this guy was going behind our backs that bothered me. As is pretty clear already, there were a whole lot of underhanded things going on. What really ate at me was that this schmuck, who wasn't an FBI-trained hostage negotiator, had pulled off something that I hadn't been able to. He'd gotten to speak to Martin Burnham on the phone. For free. That's when I realized that this crooked pol's success where we had failed was a kind of metaphor for everything that was wrong with our one-dimensional mindset. Beyond our problems with the Philippine military, the big reason we had no effective influence with the kidnappers and hostages was that we had this very tit-for-tat mentality. Under that mentality, if we called up the bad guys we were asking for something, and if they gave it to us we had to give them something back. And so, because we were positive that the Burnhams were alive, we'd never bothered to call and ask for proof of life. We were afraid to go into debt. If we made an \"ask\" and they granted it, we'd owe. Not making good on a debt risked the accusation of bad-faith negotiation and bad faith in kidnappings gets people killed. And of course we didn't ask the kidnappers to talk directly to the hostage because we knew they'd say \"no\" and we were afraid of being embarrassed. That fear was a major flaw in our negotiating mindset. There is some information that you can only get through direct, extended interactions with your counterpart. We also needed new ways to get things without asking for them. We needed to finesse making an \"ask\" with something more sophisticated than closed-ended questions with their yes-no dynamic. That's when I realized that what we had been doing wasn't communication; it was verbal flexing. We wanted them to see things our way and they wanted us to see it their way. If you let this dynamic loose in the real world, negotiation breaks down and tensions flare. That whole ethos permeated everything the FBI was doing. Everything was a showdown. And it didn't work. Our approach to proof-of-life questions embodied all these problems. At the time, we proved that our hostages were alive by devising questions that asked for a piece of information only the hostage could know. Computer-security-style questions, like, \"What's the name of Martin's first dog?\" or \"What's Martin's dad's middle name?\"\nThis particular type of question had many failings, however. For one thing, it had sort of become a signature of law enforcement in the kidnapping world. When a family starts asking a question of that type, it's a near certainty that the cops are coaching them. And that makes kidnappers very nervous. Even beyond the nerves, you had the problem that answering questions like those required little, if any, effort. The bad guys go and get the fact and give it to you right away, because it's so easy. Bang, bang, bang! It happens so fast that you didn't gain any tactical advantage, any usable information, any effort on their part toward a goal that serves you. And all negotiation, done well, should be an information-gathering process that vests your counterpart in an outcome that serves you. Worst of all, the bad guys know that they have just given you something-a proof of life-which triggers this whole human reciprocity gene. Whether we like to recognize it or not, a universal rule of human nature, across all cultures, is that when somebody gives you something, they expect something in return. And they won't give anything else until you pay them back. Now, we didn't want to trigger this whole reciprocity thing because we didn't want to give anything. So what happened? All of our conversations became these paralyzed confrontations between two parties who wanted to extract something from each other but didn't want to give. We didn't communicate, out of pride and fear. That's why we failed, while numbskulls like this crooked Philippine politician just stumbled in and got what we so desperately needed. That is, communication without reciprocity. I sat back and wondered to myself, How the hell do\nSUSPEND UNBELIEF\nWhile I was racking my brains over how this sleazy politician managed to get Martin Burnham on the phone while we never could, FBI Pittsburgh had a kidnapping case. My partner Chuck brought me the tapes from the case because he thought it was funny. You see, one Pittsburgh drug dealer had kidnapped the girlfriend of another Pittsburgh drug dealer, and for whatever reason the victim drug dealer came to the FBI for help. Coming to the FBI seemed kind of contrary to his best interests, being a drug dealer and all, but he did it because no matter who you are, when you need help you go to the FBI. Right? On the tapes, our hostage negotiators are riding around with this drug dealer while he's negotiating with the other drug dealer. Normally we would have had the guy ask a bulletproof proof-of-life\nquestion, like, \"What was the name of the girlfriend's teddy bear when she was little?\" But in this situation, this drug dealer hadn't yet been coached on asking a \"correct\" question.",

The kidnapper actually went silent for ten seconds. He was completely taken aback. Then he said, in a much less confrontational tone of voice, \"Well, I'll put her on the phone.\" I was floored because this unsophisticated drug dealer just pulled off a phenomenal victory in the negotiation. To get the kidnapper to\nto put the victim on the phone is massively huge. That's when I had my \"Holy shit!\" moment and realized that this is the technique I'd been waiting for. Instead of asking some closed-ended question with a single correct answer, he'd asked an open-ended, yet calibrated one that forced the other guy to pause and actually think about how to solve\nproblem. I thought to myself, This is perfect! It's a natural and normal question, not a request for a fact. It's a \"how\" question, and \"how\" engages because \"how\" asks for help. Best of all, he doesn't owe the kidnapper a damn thing. The guy volunteers to put the girlfriend on the phone: he thinks it's his idea. The guy who just offered to put the girlfriend on the line thinks he's in control. And the secret to gaining the upper hand in a negotiation is giving the other side the illusion of control. The genius of this technique is really well explained by something that the psychologist Kevin Dutton says in his book\nSplit-Second Persuasion\nHe talks about what he calls \"unbelief,\" which is active resistance to what the other side is saying, complete rejection. That's where the two parties in a negotiation usually start. If you don't ever get off that dynamic, you end up having showdowns, as each side tries to impose its point of view. You get two hard skulls banging against each other, like in Dos Palmas. But if you can get the other side to drop their unbelief, you can slowly work them\npoint of view on the back of\nenergy, just like the drug dealer's question got the kidnapper to volunteer to do what the drug dealer wanted. You don't directly persuade them to see your ideas. Instead, you ride them to your ideas. As the saying goes, the best way to ride a horse is in the direction in which it is going. Our job as persuaders is easier than we think. It's not to get others believing what we say. It's just to stop them unbelieving. Once we achieve that, the game's half-won. \"Unbelief is the friction that keeps persuasion in check,\" Dutton says. \"Without it, there'd be no limits.\"\nGiving your counterpart the illusion of control by asking calibrated questions-by asking for help-is one of the most powerful tools for suspending unbelief. Not long ago, I read this great article in the\nNew York Times\nby a medical student who was faced with a patient who had ripped out his IV, packed his bags, and was making a move to leave because his biopsy results were days late and he was tired of waiting. Just then a senior physician arrived. After calmly offering the patient a glass of water and asking if they could chat for a minute, he said he understood why the patient was pissed off and promised to call the lab to see why the results were delayed. But what he did next is what really suspended the patient's unbelief: he asked a calibrated question-what he felt was so important about leaving-and then when the patient said he had errands to handle, the doctor offered to connect the patient with services that could help him get them done. And, boom, the patient volunteered to stay. What's so powerful about the senior doctor's technique is that he took what was a showdown-\"I'm going to leave\" versus \"You can't leave\"-and asked questions that led the patient to solve his own problem . . . in the way the doctor wanted. It was still a kind of showdown, of course, but the doctor took the confrontation and bravado out of it by giving the patient the illusion of control. As an old\nWashington Post\neditor named Robert Estabrook\nonce said, \"He who has learned to disagree without being disagreeable has discovered the most valuable secret of negotiation.\"\nThis same technique for suspending unbelief that you use with kidnappers and escaping patients works for anything, even negotiating prices. When you go into a store, instead of telling the salesclerk what you \"need,\" you can describe what you're looking for and ask for suggestions. Then, once you've picked out what you want, instead of hitting them with a hard offer, you can just say the price is a bit more than you budgeted and ask for help with one of the greatest-of-all-time calibrated questions: \"How am I supposed to do that?\" The critical part of this approach is that you really are asking for help and your delivery must convey that. With this negotiating scheme, instead of bullying the clerk, you're asking for their advice and giving them the illusion of control. Asking for help in this manner, after you've already been engaged in a dialogue, is an incredibly powerful negotiating technique for transforming encounters from confrontational showdowns into joint problem-solving sessions. And calibrated questions are the best tool.",

Asking for help in this manner, after you've already been engaged in a dialogue, is an incredibly powerful negotiating technique for transforming encounters from confrontational showdowns into joint problem-solving sessions. And calibrated questions are the best tool. CALIBRATE YOUR QUESTIONS\nA few years ago, I was consulting with a client who had a small firm that did public relations for a large corporation. The folks at the big company were not paying their bills, and as time went on, they owed my client more and more money. They kept her on the hook by promising lots of repeat business, implying that she would get a pile of revenue if she just kept working. She felt trapped. My advice for her was simple: I told her to engage them in a conversation where she summarized the situation and then asked, \"How am I supposed to do that?\"\nShe shook her head. No way. The idea of having to ask this question just terrified her. \"If they tell me I have to, then I'm trapped!\" was her reaction. She also heard the question as \"You're screwing me out of money and it has to stop.\" That sounded like the first step to her getting fired as a consultant. I explained to her that this implication, though real, was in her mind. Her client would hear the words and not the implication as long as she kept calm and avoided making it sound by her delivery like an accusation or threat. As long as she stayed cool, they would hear it as a problem to be solved. She didn't quite believe me. We walked through the script several times, but she was still afraid. Then a few days later she called me, totally giddy with happiness. The client had called with another request and she had finally gotten up the courage to summarize the situation, and ask, \"How am I supposed to do that?\"\nAnd you know what? The answer she got was \"You're right, you can't and I apologize.\" Her client explained that they were going through some internal problems, but she was given a new accounting contact and told she'd be paid within forty-eight hours. And she was. Now, think about how my client's question worked: without accusing them of anything, it pushed the big company to understand her problem and offer the solution she wanted. That in a nutshell is the whole point of open-ended questions that are calibrated for a specific effect. Like the softening words and phrases \"perhaps,\" \"maybe,\" \"I think,\" and \"it seems,\" the calibrated open-ended question takes the aggression out of a confrontational statement or close-ended request that might otherwise anger your counterpart. What makes them work is that they are subject to interpretation by your counterpart instead of being rigidly defined. They allow you to introduce ideas and requests without sounding overbearing or pushy. And that's the difference between \"You're screwing me out of money, and it has to stop\" and \"How am I supposed to do that?\"\nThe real beauty of calibrated questions is the fact that they offer no target for attack like statements do. Calibrated questions have the power to educate your counterpart on what the problem is rather than causing conflict by\nthem what the problem is. But calibrated questions are not just random requests for comment. They have a direction: once you figure out where you want a conversation to go, you have to design the questions that will ease the conversation in that direction while letting the other guy think it's his choice to take you there. That's why I refer to these questions as\ncalibrated\nquestions. You have to calibrate them carefully, just like you would calibrate a gun sight or a measuring scale, to target a specific problem. The good news is that there are rules for that. First off, calibrated questions avoid verbs or words like \"can,\" \"is,\" \"are,\" \"do,\" or \"does.\" These are closed-ended questions that can be answered with a simple \"yes\" or a \"no.\" Instead, they start with a list of words people know as reporter's questions: \"who,\" \"what,\" \"when,\" \"where,\" \"why,\" and \"how.\" Those words inspire your counterpart to think and then speak expansively. But let me cut the list even further: it's best to start with \"what,\" \"how,\" and\n\"why.\" Nothing else. \"Who,\" \"when,\" and \"where\" will often just get your counterpart to share a fact without thinking. And \"why\" can backfire. Regardless of what language the word \"why\" is translated into, it's accusatory. There are very rare moments when this is to your advantage. The only time you can use \"why\" successfully is when the defensiveness that is created supports the change you are trying to get them to see. \"Why would you ever change from the way you've always done things and try my approach?\" is an example. \"Why would your company ever change from your long-standing vendor and choose our\ncompany?\" is another. As always, tone of voice, respectful and deferential, is critical. Otherwise, treat \"why\" like a burner on a hot stove-don't touch it. Having just two words to start with might not seem like a lot of ammunition, but trust me, you can use \"what\" and \"how\" to calibrate nearly any question. \"Does this look like something you would like?\" can become \"How does this look to you?\" or \"What about this works for you?\" You can even ask, \"What about this doesn't work for you?\" and you'll probably trigger quite a bit of useful information from your counterpart.",

Even something as harsh as \"Why did you do it?\" can be calibrated to \"What caused you to do it?\" which takes away the emotion and makes the question less accusatory. You should use calibrated questions early and often, and there are a few that you will find that you will use in the beginning of nearly every negotiation. \"What is the biggest challenge you face?\" is one of those questions. It just gets the other side to teach you something about themselves, which is critical to any negotiation because all negotiation is an information-gathering process. Here are some other great standbys that I use in almost every negotiation, depending on the situation:\nWhat about this is important to you? How can I help to make this better for us? How would you like me to proceed? What is it that brought us into this situation? How can we solve this problem? What's the objective? / What are we trying to accomplish here? How am I supposed to do that? The implication of any well-designed calibrated question is that you want what the other guy wants but you need his intelligence to overcome the problem. This really appeals to very aggressive or egotistical counterparts. You've not only implicitly asked for help-triggering goodwill and less defensiveness-but you've engineered a situation in which your formerly recalcitrant counterpart is now using his mental and emotional resources to overcome\nchallenges. It is the first step in your counterpart internalizing your way-and the obstacles in it-as his own. And that guides the other party toward designing a solution. Think back to how the doctor used calibrated questions to get his patient to stay. As his story showed, the key to getting people to see things your way is not to confront them on their ideas (\"You can't leave\") but to acknowledge their ideas openly (\"I understand why you're pissed off\") and then guide them toward solving the problem (\"What do you hope to accomplish by leaving?\"). Like I said before, the secret to gaining the upper hand in a negotiation is giving the other side the illusion of control. That's why calibrated questions are ingenious: Calibrated questions make your counterpart feel like they're in charge, but it's really you who are framing the conversation. Your counterpart will have no idea how constrained they are by your questions. Once I was negotiating with one of my FBI bosses about attending a Harvard executive program. He had already approved the expenditure for the travel, but on the day before I was supposed to leave he called me into his office and began to question the validity of the trip. I knew him well enough to know that he was trying to show me that he was in charge. So after we talked for a while, I looked at him and asked, \"When you originally approved this trip, what did you have in mind?\"\nHe visibly relaxed as he sat back in his chair and brought the top of his fingers and thumbs together in the shape of a steeple. Generally this is a body language that means the person feels superior and in charge. \"Listen,\" he said, \"just make sure you brief everyone when you get back.\"\nThat question, calibrated to acknowledge his power and nudge him toward explaining himself, gave him the illusion of control. And it got me just what I wanted. TO GET PAID\nLet's pause for a minute here, because there's one vitally important thing you have to remember when you enter a negotiation armed with your list of calibrated questions. That is, all of this is great, but there's a rub: without self-control and emotional regulation, it doesn't work. The very first thing I talk about when I'm training new negotiators is the critical importance of self-control. If you can't control your own emotions, how can you expect to influence the emotions of another party? To show you what I mean, let me tell you a story. Not long ago, a freelance marketing strategist came to me with a problem. One of her clients had hired a new CEO, a penny pincher whose strategy was to cut costs by offshoring everything he could. He was also a male chauvinist who didn't like the assertive style in which the strategist, a woman, conducted herself. Immediately my client and the CEO started to go at each other on conference calls in that passive-aggressive way that is ever present in corporate America. After a few weeks of this, my client decided she'd had enough and invoiced the CEO for the last bit of work she'd done\n(about $7,000) and politely said that the arrangement wasn't working out. The CEO answered by saying the bill was too high, that he'd pay half of it and that they would talk about the rest. After that, he stopped answering her calls. The underlying dynamic was that this guy didn't like being questioned by anyone, especially a woman. So she and I developed a strategy that showed him she understood where she went wrong and acknowledged his power, while at the same time directing his energy toward solving her problem. The script we came up with hit all the best practices of negotiation we've talked about so far.",

The script we came up with hit all the best practices of negotiation we've talked about so far. Here it is by steps:\nA \"No\"-oriented email question to reinitiate contact: \"Have you given up on settling this amicably?\"\nA statement that leaves only the answer of \"That's right\" to form a dynamic of agreement: \"It seems that you feel my bill is not justified.\"\nCalibrated questions about the problem to get him to reveal his thinking: \"How does this bill violate our agreement?\"\nMore \"No\"-oriented questions to remove unspoken barriers: \"Are you saying I misled you?\" \"Are you saying I didn't do as you asked?\" \"Are you saying I reneged on our agreement?\" or \"Are you saying I failed you?\"\nLabeling and mirroring the essence of his answers if they are not acceptable so he has to consider them again: \"It seems like you feel my work was subpar.\" Or \". . . my work was subpar?\"\nA calibrated question in reply to any offer other than full payment, in order to get him to offer a solution: \"How am I supposed to accept that?\"\nIf none of this gets an offer of full payment, a label that flatters his sense of control and power: \"It seems like you are the type of person who prides himself on the way he does business-rightfully so-and has a knack for not only expanding the pie but making the ship run more efficiently.\"\nA long pause and then one more \"No\"-oriented question: \"Do you want to be known as someone who doesn't fulfill agreements?\"\nFrom my long experience in negotiation, scripts like this have a 90 percent success rate. That is, if the negotiator stays calm and rational. And that's a big\nIn this case, she didn't. The first step-the magic email-worked better than she imagined, and the CEO called within ten minutes, surprising her. Almost immediately her anger flared at the sound of his patronizing voice. Her only desire became to show him how he was wrong, to impose her will, and the conversation became a showdown that went nowhere. You probably don't need me to tell you that she didn't even get half. With that in mind, I want to end this chapter with some advice on how to remain rational in a negotiation. Even with all the best techniques and strategy, you need to regulate your emotions if you want to have any hope of coming out on top. The first and most basic rule of keeping your emotional cool is to bite your tongue. Not literally, of course. But you have to keep away from knee-jerk, passionate reactions. Pause. Think. Let the passion dissipate. That allows you to collect your thoughts and be more circumspect in what you say. It also lowers your chance of saying more than you want to. The Japanese have this figured out. When negotiating with a foreigner, it's common practice for a Japanese businessman to use a translator even when he understands perfectly what the other side is saying. That's because speaking through a translator forces him to step back. It gives him time to frame his response. Another simple rule is, when you are verbally assaulted, do not counterattack. Instead, disarm your counterpart by asking a calibrated question. The next time a waiter or salesclerk tries to engage you in a verbal skirmish, try this out. I promise you it will change the entire tenor of the conversation. The basic issue here is that when people feel that they are not in control, they adopt what psychologists call a hostage mentality. That is, in moments of conflict they react to their lack of power by either becoming extremely defensive or lashing out. Neurologically, in situations like this the fight-or-flight mechanism in the reptilian brain or the emotions in the limbic system overwhelm the rational part of our mind, the neocortex, leading us to overreact in an impulsive, instinctive way. In a negotiation, like in the one between my client and the CEO, this always produces a negative outcome. So we have to train our neocortex to override the emotions from the other two brains. That means biting your tongue and learning how to mindfully change your state to something more positive. And it means lowering the hostage mentality in your counterpart by asking a question or even offering an apology. (\"You're right. That was a bit harsh.\")\nIf you were able to take an armed kidnapper who'd been surrounded by police and hook him up to a cardiac monitor, you'd find that every calibrated question and apology would lower his heart rate just a little bit. And that's how you get to a dynamic where solutions can be found. KEY LESSONS\nWho has control in a conversation, the guy listening or the guy talking? The listener, of course. That's because the talker is revealing information while the listener, if he's trained well, is directing the conversation toward his own goals. He's harnessing the talker's energy for his own ends. When you try to work the skills from this chapter into your daily life, remember that these are listener's tools. They are not about strong-arming your opponent into submission. Rather, they're about using the counterpart's power to get to your objective. They're listener's judo. As you put listener's judo into practice, remember the following powerful lessons:\nDon't try to force your opponent to admit that you are right.

These require little thought and inspire the human need for reciprocity; you will be expected to give something back. Ask calibrated questions that start with the words \"How\" or \"What.\" By implicitly asking the other party for help, these questions will give your counterpart an illusion of control and will inspire them to speak at length, revealing important information. Don't ask questions that start with \"Why\" unless you want your counterpart to defend a goal that serves you. \"Why\" is always an accusation, in any language. Calibrate your questions to point your counterpart toward solving your problem. This will encourage them to expend their energy on devising a solution. Bite your tongue. When you're attacked in a negotiation, pause and avoid angry emotional reactions. Instead, ask your counterpart a calibrated question. There is always a team on the other side.

      "text": "GUARANTEE EXECUTION\nuring a dangerous and chaotic prison siege in St. Martin Parish, Louisiana, a few years ago, a group of inmates armed with makeshift knives took the warden and some of his staff hostage. The situation was especially nervy because the prisoners were both tense and disorganized, a worrisome mix that meant anything could happen. The negotiators sensed that, beneath the bluster, the prisoners didn't really want to hurt the staff. They knew that they felt backed into a corner and, more than anything, they wanted the situation to end. But there was a stumbling block: the inmates were afraid that the prisoners who gave up after taking correctional officers hostage, not to mention the warden, would end up beaten, and badly. So the negotiators delivered a pair of walkie-talkies to the inmates and designed this elaborate surrender ritual to get the hostage-takers to end the siege. The idea was elegantly simple:\nThe inmates would send out one of their guys with a walkie-talkie, and he'd walk past the three perimeters of combined multiagency law enforcement that were stationed outside the prison. Once he'd walked past the final perimeter, he'd get into the paddy wagon and be transferred to jail. There, he'd use the walkie-talkie to call the guys back in\nthe prison and say, essentially, \"They didn't kick my ass.\" And they'd know it was okay to come out just like he did, one at a time. After some haggling, the inmates agreed with the plan and the first inmate comes out. It starts off great. He walks past the federal zone, then the SWAT zone, and then he makes it to the outer perimeter. But just as he's about to climb into the paddy wagon, some guy sees the walkie-talkie and says, \"What the hell are you doing with that?\" and confiscates it before sending the guy off to the jail. The inmates back in the prison start to freak out because their buddy hasn't called. The one with the other walkie-talkie calls the negotiators and starts yelling, \"Why didn't he call? They're kicking his ass. We told you!\" He starts talking about cutting off a hostage's finger, just to make sure the negotiators know the inmates are for real. Now it's the negotiators who are freaking out. They sprint to the perimeter and start screaming at everyone. It's life and death at stake. Or at least an amputated finger. Finally, fifteen nail-biting minutes later, this SWAT guy comes striding up, all proud of himself. \"Some idiot gave this dude a radio,\" he says, and sort of smiles as he hands the negotiators the walkie-talkie. The negotiators barely stop themselves from slugging the guy before they tear off to the jail to have the first inmate call in. Crisis averted, but barely. The point here is that your job as a negotiator isn't just to get to an agreement. It's getting to one that can be implemented and making sure that happens. Negotiators have to be decision architects: they have to dynamically and adaptively design the verbal and nonverbal elements of the negotiation to gain both consent\nexecution. \"Yes\" is nothing without \"How.\" While an agreement is nice, a contract is better, and a signed check is best. You don't get your profits with the agreement. They come upon implementation. Success isn't the hostage-taker saying, \"Yes, we have a deal\"; success comes afterward, when the freed hostage says to your face, \"Thank you.\"\nIn this chapter, I'll show how to drive toward and achieve consent, both with those at the negotiating table and with the invisible forces \"underneath\" it; distinguish true buy-in from fake acquiescence; and guarantee execution using the Rule of Three. \"YES\" IS NOTHING WITHOUT \"HOW\"\nAbout a year after the Dos Palmas crisis, I was teaching at the FBI Academy in Quantico when the Bureau got an urgent call from the State Department: an American had been kidnapped in the Ecuadoran jungle by a Colombia-based rebel group. As the FBI's lead international hostage negotiator, this was my baby, so I put a team together and set up operation headquarters in Quantico. For a few years, Jos\u00e9 and his wife, Julie, had been guiding tour groups through the jungle near the Colombian border. Born in Ecuador, Jos\u00e9 had become an American citizen and was working as a paramedic in New York City when he and Julie decided to set up an ecotourism business in his native country. Jos\u00e9 loved the Ecuadoran jungle, and he'd long dreamed of teaching visitors about the monkeys that swung through the trees and the flowers that perfumed the trails. The business grew as ecotourists fell for the pair's obvious passion, and on August 20, 2003, Jos\u00e9 and Julie took eleven people on a white-water rafting trip down the Mira River. After a great day on the water, everyone was smiling and soaked as they piled into Jeeps and pickups for the ride to an inn in a nearby village. Jos\u00e9 told tall tales as he drove the lead truck, Julie to his right with their eleven-month-old baby in her lap. They were five minutes from the inn when three men jumped into the road and aimed guns at the truck. A fourth man emerged and held a revolver to Julie's head as the thugs pulled Jos\u00e9 from the car\nand forced him into the truck bed. The kidnappers then ordered the caravan through several small towns to a fork in the road, where they got out and walked Jos\u00e9 past Julie's seat in the cab. \"Just remember,\" Julie said, \"no matter what happens, I love you.\"\n\"Don't worry. I'll be fine,\" Jos\u00e9 answered. And then he and his captors disappeared into the jungle. The captors wanted $5 million. We wanted to buy time. Ever since the Dos Palmas debacle and the Pittsburgh epiphany, I had been raring to employ the lessons we'd learned about calibrated questions.",

Ever since the Dos Palmas debacle and the Pittsburgh epiphany, I had been raring to employ the lessons we'd learned about calibrated questions. So when Jos\u00e9 was kidnapped, I sent my guys down to Ecuador and told them that we had a new strategy. The kidnapping would provide an opportunity to prove this approach. \"All we're going to say is, 'Hey, how do we know Jos\u00e9 is okay? How are we supposed to pay until we know Jos\u00e9 is okay?' Again and again,\" I told them. Although they were queasy about untested techniques, my guys were game. The local cops were livid, though, because they always did proof of life the old-fashioned way (which the FBI had taught them in the first place). Luckily Julie was with us 100 percent because she saw how the calibrated questions would stall for time, and she was convinced that with enough time her husband would find a way to get home. The day after the kidnapping, the rebels marched Jos\u00e9 into the mountains along the Colombian border and settled in a cabin high in the jungle. There Jos\u00e9 built a rapport with the kidnappers to make himself harder for them to kill. He impressed them with his knowledge of the jungle and, with a black belt in karate, he filled the time by teaching them martial arts. My negotiators coached Julie every day as we waited for contact from the rebels. We learned later that the designated negotiator from Jos\u00e9's captors had to walk to town to negotiate by phone. My guys told Julie to answer every one of the kidnappers' demands with a question. My strategy was to keep the kidnappers engaged but off balance. \"How do I know Jos\u00e9 is alive?\" she asked the first time they talked. To their demand for $5 million, she said, \"We don't have that kind of money. How can we raise that much?\"\n\"How can we pay you anything until we know Jos\u00e9 is okay?\" Julie asked the next time they talked. Questions, always questions. The kidnapper who was negotiating with Julie seemed extremely perplexed by her persistent questions, and he kept asking for time to think. That slowed everything down, but he never got angry with Julie. Answering questions gave him the illusion that he had control of the negotiation. By constantly asking questions and making minuscule offers, Julie drove the ransom down to $16,500. When they came to that number, the kidnappers demanded she get it to them immediately. \"How can I do that when I have to sell my cars and trucks?\" she asked. Always buying more time. We were starting to grin because success was within reach; we were really close to a ransom that the family could afford. And then I got a phone call in the middle of the night from one of my deployed guys in Ecuador, Kevin Rust. Kevin is a terrific negotiator and the same guy who'd called to tell me a year earlier that Martin Burnham had been killed. My stomach tied into a knot when I heard his voice. \"We just got a call from Jos\u00e9,\" Kevin said. \"He's still in guerrilla territory but he escaped and he's on a bus and he's making his way out.\"\nIt took me half a minute to respond, and when I did all I could say was \"Holy shit! That's fantastic news!\"\nWhat had happened, we learned later, was that with all the delays and questions, some of the guerrillas peeled off and didn't return. Pretty soon there was only one teenager guarding Jos\u00e9 at night. He saw an opening late one evening when it began to chuck down rain. Pounding on the metal roof, the rain drowned out all other sound as the lone guard slept. Knowing the wet leaves outside would absorb the sound of his footsteps, Jos\u00e9 climbed through the window, ran down jungle paths to a dirt road, and worked his way to a small town. Two days later he was back with Julie and their baby, just a few days before his daughter's first birthday. Julie was right: with enough time he had found a way home. Calibrated \"How\" questions are a surefire way to keep negotiations going. They put the pressure on your counterpart to come up with answers, and to contemplate your problems when making their demands. With enough of the right \"How\" questions you can read and shape the negotiating environment in such a way that you'll eventually get to the answer you want to hear. You just have to have an idea of where you want the conversation to go when you're devising your questions. The trick to \"How\" questions is that, correctly used, they are gentle and graceful ways to say \"No\" and guide your counterpart to develop a better solution-\nsolution. A gentle How/No invites collaboration and leaves your counterpart with a feeling of having been treated with respect. Look back at what Julie did when the Colombian rebel kidnappers made their first demands. \"How can we raise that much?\" she asked. Notice that she did not use the word \"No.\" But she still managed to elegantly deny the kidnappers' $5 million demand. As Julie did, the first and most common \"No\" question you'll use is some version of \"How am I supposed to do that?\" (for example, \"How can we raise that much?\"). Your tone of voice is critical as this phrase\ncan be delivered as either an accusation or a request for assistance.",

As Julie did, the first and most common \"No\" question you'll use is some version of \"How am I supposed to do that?\" (for example, \"How can we raise that much?\"). Your tone of voice is critical as this phrase can be delivered as either an accusation or a request for assistance. So pay attention to your voice. This question tends to have the positive effect of making the other side take a good look at your situation. This positive dynamic is what I refer to as \"forced empathy,\" and it's especially effective if leading up to it you've already been empathic with your counterpart. This engages the dynamic of reciprocity to lead them to do something for you. Starting with Jos\u00e9's kidnapping, \"How am I supposed to do that?\" became our primary response to a kidnapper demanding a ransom. And we never had it backfire. Once I was working with an accounting consultant named Kelly who was owed a pile of money by a corporate client. She kept consulting because she believed she was developing a useful contact, and because the promise of a future payday seemed to justify continuing in good faith. But at a certain point Kelly was so far behind on her own bills that she was in a bind. She couldn't continue to work with only a vague idea of when she'd get paid, but she worried that if she pushed too hard she wouldn't get paid at all. I told her to wait until the client asked for more work, because if she made a firm payment demand right away she would be vulnerable if they refused. Luckily for Kelly, the client soon called to ask her for more work. Once he finished his request, she calmly asked a \"How\" question:\n\"I'd love to help,\" she said, \"but how am I supposed to do that?\"\nBy indicating her willingness to work but asking for help finding a way to do so, she left her deadbeat customer with no choice but to put her needs ahead of everything else. And she got paid. Besides saying \"No,\" the other key benefit of asking \"How?\" is, quite literally, that it forces your counterpart to consider and explain how a\ndeal will be implemented. A deal is nothing without good implementation. Poor implementation is the cancer that eats your profits. By making your counterparts articulate implementation in their own words, your carefully calibrated \"How\" questions will convince them that the final solution is\nidea. And that's crucial. People always make more effort to implement a solution when they think it's theirs. That is simply human nature. That's why negotiation is often called \"the art of letting someone else have your way.\"\nThere are two key questions you can ask to push your counterparts to think they are defining success\nway: \"How will we know we're on track?\" and \"How will we address things if we find we're off track?\" When they answer, you summarize their answers until you get a \"That's right.\" Then you'll know they've bought in. On the flip side, be wary of two telling signs that your counterpart\nbelieve the idea is theirs. As I've noted, when they say, \"\nright,\" it's often a good indicator they are not vested in what is being discussed. And when you push for implementation and they say, \"I'll try,\" you should get a sinking feeling in your stomach. Because this really means, \"I plan to fail.\"\nWhen you hear either of these, dive back in with calibrated \"How\" questions until they define the terms of successful implementation in their own voice. Follow up by summarizing what they have said to get a \"That's right.\"\nLet the other side feel victory. Let them think it was their idea. Subsume your ego. Remember: \"Yes\" is nothing without \"How.\" So keep asking \"How?\" And succeed. INFLUENCING THOSE BEHIND THE TABLE\nA few weeks after Jos\u00e9 got back to the United States, I drove to his family's place in upstate New York. I was thrilled when Jos\u00e9 escaped, but the case left me with one nagging worry: Had my new strategy failed? You see, Jos\u00e9 had gotten home safely, but not because we'd negotiated his release. I worried that our winning had less to do with our brilliant strategy than with dumb luck. After being greeted warmly by Julie and her parents, Jos\u00e9 and I grabbed some coffee and sat down. I'd gone there to do what CNU referred to as a hostage survival debriefing. I was after insights into how to better advise people facing potential kidnappings how best to survive, not just physically, but psychologically. I was also burning to find out what had occurred behind the scenes because it seemed as if my new strategy hadn't worked. Finally the conversation came around to our use of calibrated questions. \"You know what?\" he said. \"The craziest thing was that their negotiator was supposed to stay in town and negotiate the deal but because Julie kept asking him questions he didn't really know for sure how to answer, he kept coming out to the jungle. They all would get together and have a huge discussion about how to respond. They even thought about taking me into town and putting me on the phone because Julie was so persistent with asking how did she know if I was okay.\"\nRight then I knew we had the right tool.",

They even thought about taking me into town and putting me on the phone because Julie was so persistent with asking how did she know if I was okay.\" Right then I knew we had the right tool. It was exactly the opposite of the Burnham case, where our negotiator cut the deal with one of the guys and then the rest of them took the $300,000 and said, \"No, we're not doing that.\" Causing the other side to work that hard and forcing that much internal coordination in service of our own goals was unprecedented. Our negotiating strategy in Ecuador worked not just because the questions contributed to the environment that let Jos\u00e9 escape, but because they made sure the kidnappers-our counterparts-were all on the same page. Yes, few hostage-takers-and few business deal makers-fly solo. But for the most part, there are almost always other players, people\nwho can act as deal makers or deal killers. If you truly want to get to \"Yes\"\nget your deal implemented, you have to discover how to affect these individuals. When implementation happens by committee, the support of that committee is key. You always have to identify and unearth their motivations, even if you haven't yet identified each individual on that committee. That can be easy as asking a few calibrated questions, like \"How does this affect the rest of your team?\" or \"How on board are the people not on this call?\" or simply \"What do your colleagues see as their main challenges in this area?\"\nThe larger concept I'm explaining here is that in any negotiation you have to analyze the entire negotiation space. When other people will be affected by what is negotiated and can assert their rights or power later on, it's just stupid to consider only the interests of those at the negotiation table. You have to beware of \"behind the table\" or \"Level II\" players-that is, parties that are not directly involved but who can help implement agreements they like and block ones they don't. You can't disregard them even when you're talking to a CEO. There could always be someone whispering into his ear. At the end of the day, the deal killers often are more important than the deal makers. Think back to the prison siege: it was almost ruined because one bit player on our side was not totally on board. That's what our use of calibrated questions in Ecuador avoided, and that's why Jos\u00e9's case was a home run. It only takes one bit player to screw up a deal. A few years into private practice I'd lost sight of the importance of assessing and influencing the hidden negotiation that happens \"behind the table,\" and I paid a substantial price. We were closing a deal with a big company in Florida that wanted negotiation training for one of its divisions. We'd been on the phone a bunch of times with the CEO and the head of HR, and they were both\n100 percent gung ho on our offering. We were elated-we had what we thought was total buy-in from the top decision makers for an incredibly lucrative deal. And then, as we were figuring out the small print, the deal fell off the table. It turns out that the head of the division that needed the training killed the deal. Maybe this guy felt threatened, slighted, or otherwise somehow personally injured by the notion that he and his people \"needed\" any training at all. (A surprisingly high percentage of negotiations hinge on something outside dollars and cents, often having more to do with self-esteem, status, and other nonfinancial needs.) We'll never know now. The point is, we didn't care until too late because we convinced ourselves that we were on the phone with the only decision makers that mattered. We could have avoided all that had we asked a few calibrated questions, like: How does this affect everybody else? How on board is the rest of your team? How do we make sure that we deliver the right material to the right people? How do we ensure the managers of those we're training are fully on board? If we had asked questions like that, the CEO and HR head would have checked with this guy, maybe even brought him into the conversation. And saved us all a lot of pain. SPOTTING LIARS, DEALING WITH JERKS, AND CHARMING EVERYONE ELSE\nAs a negotiator, you're going to run into guys who lie to your face and try to scare you into agreement. Aggressive jerks and serial fabricators come with the territory, and dealing with them is something you have to do. But learning how to handle aggression and identify falsehood is just part of a larger issue: that is, learning how to spot and interpret the subtleties of communication-both verbal and nonverbal-that reveal the mental states of your counterparts. Truly effective negotiators are conscious of the verbal, paraverbal (how it's said), and nonverbal communications that pervade negotiations and group dynamics. And they know how to employ those subtleties to their benefit. Even changing a single word when you present options-like using \"not lose\" instead of \"keep\"-can unconsciously influence the conscious choices your counterpart makes. Here I want to talk about the tools you need to ID liars, disarm jerks, and charm everybody else. Of course, the open-ended \"How\" question is one of them-maybe the most important one-but there are many more. Alastair Onglingswan was living in the Philippines when, one evening in 2004, he hailed a taxi and settled in for a long ride home from Manila's Greenhills shopping center.",

Here I want to talk about the tools you need to ID liars, disarm jerks, and charm everybody else. Of course, the open-ended \"How\" question is one of them-maybe the most important one-but there are many more. Alastair Onglingswan was living in the Philippines when, one evening in 2004, he hailed a taxi and settled in for a long ride home from Manila's Greenhills shopping center. He dozed off. And he woke up in chains. Unfortunately for Alastair, the cabbie had a second business as a kidnapper. He kept a bottle of ether in his front seat, and when a target fell asleep he would drug him, imprison him, and ask for ransom. Within hours, the kidnapper used Alastair's phone to contact his girlfriend in New York. He demanded a daily payment to \"take care\" of Alastair while he researched the family's wealth. \"It's okay if you don't pay,\" he said. \"I can always sell his organs in Saudi Arabia.\"\nWithin twenty-four hours, I'd been charged with heading the negotiation from Quantico. Alastair's girlfriend was too nervous to handle the family side of the negotiation, and his mother, who lived in the Philippines, just wanted to accept any demand the kidnapper made. But Alastair's brother Aaron, in Manila, was different: he just\nthe idea of negotiation and he accepted that Alastair might die, which would make him a better and more effective negotiator. Aaron and I set up an always-on phone line and I became Aaron's guru on the other side of the world. Through the kidnapper's comments and demands, I saw that he was experienced and patient. As a token of his intentions, he offered to cut off one of Alastair's ears and send it to the family along with a video of him severing the ear. The demand for the daily payment was clearly a trick to quickly drain the family of as much money as possible while at the same time gauging their wealth. We had to figure out who this guy was-Was he a lone operator or part of a group? Did he plan on killing Alastair or not?-and we had to do that before the family went broke. To get there, we were going to have to engage the kidnapper in a protracted negotiation. We were going to have to slow everything down. From Quantico, I loaded Aaron up with calibrated questions. I instructed him to keep peppering the violent jerk with \"How?\" How am I supposed to . . . ? How do we know . . . ? How can we . . . ? There is great power in treating jerks with deference. It gives you the ability to be extremely assertive-to say \"No\"-in a hidden fashion. \"How do we know if we pay you that you won't hurt Alastair?\" Aaron asked. In the Chinese martial art of tai chi, the goal is to use your opponent's aggressiveness against him-to turn his offense into your way to defeat him. That's the approach we took with Alastair's kidnapper: we wanted to absorb his threats and wear him down. We made sure that even scheduling a call with us was complex. We delayed making email responses. Through all these tactics, we gained the upper hand while giving the kidnapper the illusion of control. He thought he was solving\nAaron's problems while we were just reading him and wasting his time. You see, it's best not to go chin to chin with aggressiveness like that of Alastair's kidnapper; rather, default to using \"what\" and \"how\" questions to avoid making bids or adjusting your own negotiating position. Dodge and weave. Finally, following days of back-and-forth bargaining on the daily rate, Aaron got the kidnapper down to a token amount and agreed to deposit a portion of the funds in his bank account. After that partial payment was made, Aaron came up with the perfect way to nonconfrontationally confront the cabbie with a calibrated \"When/What\" question. \"When we run out of money, what will happen?\" Aaron asked. The kidnapper paused. \"It will be all right,\" he finally responded. Without realizing what he had just agreed to, our killer had just promised us he wouldn't hurt Alastair. A repetitive series of \"What\" and \"How\" questions can help you overcome the aggressive tactics of a manipulative adversary. As you can see in that last exchange, the kidnapper's protracted chats with Aaron had turned Aaron almost into a friend. Over time the kidnapper had become unguarded about spending time on the phone with his \"friend.\" Finally, the Philippine National Police investigators tracked the phone to a house and raided it. The kidnapper and Alastair were not there, but the kidnapper's wife was. She told the police about another house they owned. The police quickly raided the other house, freed Alastair, and arrested the kidnapper. There are plenty of other tactics, tools, and methods for using subtle verbal and nonverbal forms of communication to understand and modify the mental states of your counterpart. As I run through some of them here, I want you to take a moment to internalize each one. These are the kind of tools that can help observant negotiators hit home runs. THE 7-38-55 PERCENT RULE\nIn two famous studies on what makes us like or dislike somebody,\nUCLA psychology professor Albert Mehrabian created the 7-38-55 rule. That is, only 7 percent of a message is based on the words while 38 percent comes from the tone of voice and 55 percent from the speaker's body language and face. While these figures mainly relate to situations where we are forming an attitude about somebody, the rule nonetheless offers a useful ratio for negotiators.

THE 7-38-55 PERCENT RULE In two famous studies on what makes us like or dislike somebody, UCLA psychology professor Albert Mehrabian created the 7-38-55 rule. That is, only 7 percent of a message is based on the words while 38 percent comes from the tone of voice and 55 percent from the speaker's body language and face. While these figures mainly relate to situations where we are forming an attitude about somebody, the rule nonetheless offers a useful ratio for negotiators. You see, body language and tone of voice-not words-are our most powerful assessment tools. That's why I'll often fly great distances to meet someone face-to-face, even when I can say much of what needs to be said over the phone. So how do you use this rule? First, pay very close attention to tone and body language to make sure they match up with the literal meaning of the words. If they don't align, it's quite possible that the speaker is lying or at least unconvinced. When someone's tone of voice or body language does not align with the meaning of the words they say, use labels to discover the source of the incongruence. Here's an example:\nYou: \"So we're agreed?\"\nThem: \"Yes . . .\"\nYou: \"I heard you say, 'Yes,' but it seemed like there was hesitation in your voice.\"\nThem: \"Oh, it's nothing really.\"\nYou: \"No, this is important, let's make sure we get this right.\"\nThem: \"Thanks, I appreciate it.\"\nThis is the way to make sure your agreement gets implemented with no surprises. And your counterpart will be grateful. Your act of recognizing the incongruence and gently dealing with it through a label will make them feel respected. Consequently, your relationship of trust will be improved. THE RULE OF THREE\nI'm positive that sometime in your life you've been involved in a negotiation where you got a \"Yes\" that later turned out to be a \"No.\" Maybe the other party was lying to you, or maybe they were just engaged in wishful thinking. Either way, this is not an uncommon experience. This happens because there are actually three kinds of \"Yes\": Commitment, Confirmation, and Counterfeit. As we discussed in Chapter 5, so many pushy salesman try to trap their clients into the Commitment \"Yes\" that many people get very good at the Counterfeit \"Yes. \"\nOne great tool for avoiding this trap is the Rule of Three. The Rule of Three is simply getting the other guy to agree to the same thing three times in the same conversation. It's tripling the strength of whatever dynamic you're trying to drill into at the moment. In doing so, it uncovers problems before they happen. It's really hard to repeatedly lie or fake conviction. When I first learned this skill, my biggest fear was how to avoid sounding like a broken record or coming off as really pushy. The answer, I learned, is to vary your tactics. The first time they agree to something or give you a commitment, that's No. 1. For No. 2 you might label or summarize what they said so they answer, \"That's right.\" And No. 3 could be a calibrated \"How\" or \"What\" question about implementation that asks them to explain\nwhat will constitute success, something like \"What do we do if we get off track?\"\nOr the three times might just be the same calibrated question phrased three different ways, like \"What's the biggest challenge you faced? What are we up against here? What do you see as being the most difficult thing to get around?\"\nEither way, going at the same issue three times uncovers falsehoods as well as the incongruences between words and body language we mentioned in the last section. So next time you're not sure your counterpart is truthful and committed, try it. THE PINOCCHIO EFFECT\nWith Carlo Collodi's famous character Pinocchio, it was easy to tell when he was lying: you just had to watch the nose. It turns out that Collodi wasn't far off reality. Most people offer obvious telltale signs when they're lying. Not a growing nose, but close enough. In a study of the components of lying,\nHarvard Business School professor Deepak Malhotra and his coauthors found that, on average, liars use more words than truth tellers and use far more third-person pronouns. They start talking about\nrather than\n, in order to put some distance between themselves and the lie. And they discovered that liars tend to speak in more complex sentences in an attempt to win over their suspicious counterparts. It's what W. C. Fields meant when he talked about baffling someone with bullshit. The researchers dubbed this the Pinocchio Effect because, just like Pinocchio's nose, the number of words grew along with the lie. People who are lying are, understandably, more worried about being believed, so they work harder-too hard, as it were-at being believable. PAY ATTENTION TO THEIR USAGE OF PRONOUNS\nThe use of pronouns by a counterpart can also help give you a feel for their actual importance in the decision and implementation chains on the other side of the table. The more in love they are with \"I,\" \"me,\" and \"my\" the less important they are. Conversely, the harder it is to get a first person pronoun out of a negotiator's mouth, the more important they are. Just like in the Malhotra study where the liar is distancing himself from the lie, in a negotiation, smart decision makers don't want to be cornered at the table into making a decision. They will defer to the people away from the table to keep from getting pinned down. Our cabdriver kidnapper in the Philippines of Alastair Onglingswan used \"we,\" \"they,\" and \"them\" so rigorously early on in the kidnapping I was convinced we were engaged with their leader. I just never knew how literally true it was until the rescue.",

I just never knew how literally true it was until the rescue. In the Chase Manhattan Bank robbery from Chapter 2, the bank robber Chris Watts consistently talked out how dangerous the \"others\" were and how little influence he had on them, all a lie. THE CHRIS DISCOUNT\nPeople always talk about remembering and using (but not\n) your counterpart's name in a negotiation. And that's important. The reality though is people are often tired of being hammered with their own name. The slick salesman trying to drive them to \"Yes\" will hit them with it over and over. Instead, take a different tack and use your own name. That's how I get the Chris discount. Just as using Alastair's name with the kidnapper and getting him to use it back humanized the hostage and made it less likely he would\nbe harmed, using your own name creates the dynamic of \"forced empathy.\" It makes the other side see you as a person. A few years ago I was in a bar in Kansas with a bunch of fellow FBI negotiators. The bar was packed, but I saw one empty chair. I moved toward it but just as I got ready to sit the guy next to it said, \"Don't even think about it.\"\n\"Why?\" I asked, and he said, \"Because I'll kick your ass.\"\nHe was big, burly, and already drunk, but look, I'm a lifelong hostage negotiator-I gravitate toward tense situations that need mediation like a moth to the flame. I held out my hand to shake his and said, \"My name is Chris.\"\nThe dude froze, and in the pause my fellow FBI guys moved in, patted him on the shoulders, and offered to buy him a drink. Turned out he was a Vietnam veteran at a particularly low point. He was in a packed bar where the entire world seemed to be celebrating. The only thing he could think of was to fight. But as soon as I became \"Chris,\" everything changed. Now take that mindset to a financial negotiation. I was in an outlet mall a few months after the Kansas experience and I picked out some shirts in one of the stores. At the front counter the young lady asked me if I wanted to join their frequent buyer program. I asked her if I got a discount for joining and she said, \"No.\"\nSo I decided to try another angle. I said in a friendly manner, \"My name is Chris. What's the Chris discount?\"\nShe looked from the register, met my eyes, and gave a little laugh. \"I'll have to ask my manager, Kathy,\" she said and turned to the woman who'd been standing next to her. Kathy, who'd heard the whole exchange, said, \"The best I can do is ten percent.\"\nHumanize yourself. Use your name to introduce yourself. Say it in a fun, friendly way. Let them enjoy the interaction, too. And get your own special price. HOW TO GET YOUR COUNTERPARTS TO BID AGAINST THEMSELVES\nLike you saw Aaron and Julie do with their kidnappers, the best way to get your counterparts to lower their demands is to say \"No\" using \"How\" questions. These indirect ways of saying \"No\" won't shut down your counterpart the way a blunt, pride-piercing \"No\" would. In fact, these responses will sound so much like counterbids that your counterparts will often keep bidding against themselves. We've found that you can usually express \"No\" four times before actually saying the word. The first step in the \"No\" series is the old standby:\n\"How am I supposed to do that?\"\nYou have to deliver it in a deferential way, so it becomes a request for help. Properly delivered, it invites the other side to participate in your dilemma and solve it with a better offer. After that, some version of \"Your offer is very generous, I'm sorry, that just doesn't work for me\" is an elegant second way to say \"No.\"\nThis well-tested response avoids making a counteroffer, and the use of \"generous\" nurtures your counterpart to live up to the word. The \"I'm sorry\" also softens the \"No\" and builds empathy. (You can ignore the so-called negotiating experts who say apologies are always signs of weakness.)\nThen you can use something like \"I'm sorry but I'm afraid I just can't do that.\" It's a little more direct, and the \"can't do that\" does great double duty. By expressing an inability to perform, it can trigger the other side's empathy toward you. \"I'm sorry, no\" is a slightly more succinct version for the fourth \"No.\" If delivered gently, it barely sounds negative at all. If you have to go further, of course, \"No\" is the last and most direct way. Verbally, it should be delivered with a downward inflection and a tone of regard; it's not meant to be \"NO!\"\nOne of my students, a guy named Jesus Bueno, wrote me not long ago to tell me an amazing story about how he'd used the multi-step \"No\" to help his brother Joaquin out of a sticky business situation. His brother and two friends had bought a cannabis grow shop franchise in northern Spain, where the cultivation of marijuana for personal use is legal.

Joaquin and his partner, Bruno, each invested 20,000 euros in the business for a 46 percent stake (a minority partner invested another \u20ac3,500 for 8 percent). From the beginning, Joaquin and Bruno had a rocky relationship. Joaquin is an excellent salesman, while Bruno was more of a bookkeeper. The minority partner was also an excellent salesman, and he and Joaquin believed that growing sales was the correct strategy. That meant offering discounts for large orders and repeat customers, which Bruno disagreed with. Their planned spending on launching a website and expanding inventory also rubbed Bruno the wrong way. Then Bruno's wife became a problem as she started nagging Joaquin about how he should not spend so much on expansion and instead take more profits. One day, Joaquin was reviewing inventory purchases and noticed that some items they had ordered had not been placed on the store's shelves. He began searching for them online and to his surprise he found an eBay store set up with the wife's first name that was selling exactly those missing products. This started a huge argument between Bruno and Joaquin, and soured their relationship. In the heat of the moment, Bruno told Joaquin that he was open to selling his shares because he felt the business risks they were taking were too large. So Joaquin consulted with his brother: my student Jesus. Because they believed that pressure from Bruno's wife was why he wanted to sell, Jesus helped Joaquin craft an empathy message around that: \"It seems like you are under a lot of pressure from your wife.\" Joaquin was also in the middle of a divorce, so they decided to use that to relate to the wife issues, and they prepared an accusation audit-\"I\nknow you think I don't care about costs and taking profits from the company\"-in order to diffuse the negative energy and get Bruno talking. It worked like a charm. Bruno immediately agreed with the accusation audit and began explaining why he thought Joaquin was careless with spending. Bruno also noted that he didn't have someone to bail him out like Joaquin did (Joaquin got a start-up loan from his mother). Joaquin used mirrors to keep Bruno talking, and he did. Finally, Joaquin said, \"I know how the pressure from your wife can feel, I'm going through a divorce myself and it really takes a lot out of you.\" Bruno then went on a ten-minute rant about his wife and let slip a huge piece of information: the wife was very upset because the bank that lent them the \u20ac20,000 had reviewed their loan and had given them two options: repay the loan in full, or pay a much higher interest rate. Joaquin and Jesus huddled after learning that, and decided that Joaquin could reasonably pay just above the loan price because Bruno had already taken \u20ac14,000 in salary from the business. The letter from the bank put Bruno in a bad spot, and Joaquin figured he could bid low because there wasn't really a market for Bruno to sell his shares. They decided that \u20ac23,000 would be the magic number, with \u20ac11,000 up front with the remaining \u20ac12,000 over a year period. Then things went sideways. Instead of waiting for Bruno to name a price, Joaquin jumped the gun and made his full offer, telling Bruno that he thought it was \"very fair.\" If there's one way to put off your counterpart, it's by implying that disagreeing with you is\nWhat happened next proved that. Bruno angrily hung up the phone and two days later Joaquin received an email from a guy saying he'd been hired to represent Bruno. They wanted \u20ac30,812: \u20ac20,000 for the loan, \u20ac4,000 for salary, \u20ac6,230 for equity, and \u20ac582 for interest. Nonround figures that seemed unchangeable in their specificity. This guy was a pro. Jesus told Joaquin that he'd truly screwed up. But they both knew that Bruno was pretty desperate to sell. So they decided to use the multi-step \"No\" strategy to get Bruno to bid against himself. The worst-case scenario, they decided, was that Bruno would just change his mind about selling his shares and the status quo would continue. It was a risk they'd have to take. They crafted their first \"No\" message:\nThe price you offered is very fair, and I certainly wish that I could afford it. Bruno has worked very hard for this business, and he deserves to be compensated appropriately. I am very sorry, but wish you the best of luck. Notice how they made no counteroffer and said \"No\" without using the word? Joaquin was shocked when the following day he received an email from the advisor lowering the price to \u20ac28,346. Joaquin and Jesus then crafted their second gentle \"No\":\nThank you for your offer. You were generous to reduce the price, which I greatly appreciate. I really wish that I could pay you this amount, but I am sincere in that I cannot afford this amount at this time. As you know, I am in the middle of a divorce and I just cannot come up with that type of money. Again, I wish you the best of luck. The next day Joaquin received a one-line email from the advisor dropping the price to \u20ac25,000. Joaquin wanted to take it but Jesus told him that he had some \"No\" steps to go. Joaquin fought him, but in the end he relented. There's a critical lesson there: The art of closing a deal is staying focused to the very end.",

There are crucial points at the finale when you must draw on your mental discipline. Don't think about what time the last flight leaves, or what it would be like to get home early and play golf. Do not let your mind wander. Remain focused. They wrote:\nThank you again for the generous offer. You have really come down on the price and I have tried very hard to come up with that amount. Unfortunately, no one is willing to lend me the money, not even my mother. I have tried various avenues but cannot come up with the funding. In the end, I can offer you \u20ac23,567, although I can only pay \u20ac15,321.37 up front. I could pay you the remainder over a one-year period, but that is really the most I can do. I wish you the best in your decision. Brilliant use of specific numbers, and what an empathy-building way to say \"No\" without using the word! And it worked. Within one hour, the advisor responded to accept. Look at this closely: see how the mixture of mirroring and open-ended questions dragged out the information about Bruno's financial problems, and then the \"No\" method exploited his desperation? It might not have been a great idea to use this method if there'd been another buyer, but with no one else it was a brilliant way to get Bruno to bid against himself. KEY LESSONS\nSuperstar negotiators-real rainmakers-know that a negotiation is a playing field beneath the words, where really getting to a good deal involves detecting and manipulating subtle, nonobvious signals\nbeneath the surface. It is only by visualizing and modifying these subsurface issues that you can craft a great deal and make sure that it is implemented. As you put the following tools to use, remember this chapter's most important concept. That is, \"Yes\" is nothing without \"How.\" Asking \"How,\" knowing \"How,\" and defining \"How\" are all part of the effective negotiator's arsenal. He would be unarmed without them. Ask calibrated \"How\" questions, and ask them again and again. Asking \"How\" keeps your counterparts engaged but off balance. Answering the questions will give them the illusion of control. It will also lead them to contemplate your problems when making their demands. Use \"How\" questions to shape the negotiating environment. You do this by using \"How can I do that?\" as a gentle version of \"No.\" This will subtly push your counterpart to search for other solutions-\nsolutions. And very often it will get them to bid against themselves. Don't just pay attention to the people you're negotiating with directly; always identify the motivations of the players \"behind the table.\" You can do so by asking how a deal will affect everybody else and how on board they are. Follow the 7-38-55 Percent Rule by paying close attention to tone of voice and body language. Incongruence between the words and nonverbal signs will show when your counterpart is lying or uncomfortable with a deal. Is the \"Yes\" real or counterfeit? Test it with the Rule of Three: use calibrated questions, summaries, and labels to get your counterpart to reaffirm their agreement at least three times. It's really hard to repeatedly lie or fake conviction. A person's use of pronouns offers deep insights into his or her relative authority. If you're hearing a lot of \"I,\" \"me,\" and \"my,\" the real power to decide probably lies elsewhere. Picking up a lot of \"we,\" \"they,\" and \"them,\" it's more likely you're dealing directly with a savvy decision maker keeping his options open. Use your own name to make yourself a real person to the other side and even get your own personal discount. Humor and humanity are the best ways to break the ice and remove roadblocks.",

      "text": "BARGAIN HARD\nfew years ago I fell in love with a red Toyota 4Runner. Actually not just \"red,\" but \"Salsa Red Pearl.\" Kind of a smoldering red that seemed to glow at night. How sexy is that? I just had to have it; getting one became my obsession. I searched the dealers in metropolitan Washington, D.C., and I quickly realized that I wasn't the only one obsessed with getting that truck: there weren't any in that color in the entire area, none at all, save at one dealer. You know how they tell you not to shop for groceries when you're hungry? Well, I was hungry. Very hungry. Actually, I was in love. . . . I sat down, centered myself, and strategized. This lot was my only shot. I had to make it count\nI drove to the dealer on a sunny Friday afternoon. I sat down across from the salesman, a nice enough guy named Stan, and told him how gorgeous the vehicle was. He offered me the usual smile-he had me, he thought-and mentioned the sticker price on \"that beautiful vehicle\": $36,000. I gave him an understanding nod and pursed my lips. The key to beginning a haggle is to rattle the other guy ever so gently. You do it\nin the nicest way possible. If I could thread that needle, I had a good chance at getting my price. \"I can pay $30,000,\" I said. \"And I can pay it up front, all cash. I'll write a check today for the full amount. I'm sorry, I'm afraid I just can't pay any more.\"\nHis smile flickered a little bit at the edges, as if it were losing focus. But he tightened it down and shook his head. \"I'm sure you can understand we can't do that. The sticker price is $36,000, after all.\"\n\"How am I supposed to do that?\" I asked deferentially. \"I'm sure,\" he said, then paused as if he wasn't sure what he'd meant to say. \"I'm sure we can figure something out with financing the $36,000.\"\n\"It's a beautiful truck. Really amazing. I can't tell you how much I'd love to have it. It's worth more than what I'm offering. I'm sorry, this is really embarrassing. I just can't do that price.\"\nHe stared at me in silence, a little befuddled now. Then he stood and went into the back for what seemed like an eternity. He was gone so long that I remember saying to myself, \"Damn! I should have come in lower! They're going to come all the way down.\" Any response that's not an outright rejection of your offer means you have the edge. He returned and told me like it was Christmas that his boss had okayed a new price: $34,000. \"Wow, your offer is very generous and this is the car of my dreams,\" I said. \"I really wish I could do that. I really do. This is so embarrassing. I simply can't.\"\nHe dropped into silence and I didn't take the bait. I let the silence linger. And then with a sigh he trudged off again. He returned after another eternity. \"You win,\" he said. \"My manager okayed $32,500.\"\nHe pushed a paper across the desk that even said \"YOU WIN\" in big letters. The words were even surrounded with smiley faces. \"I am so grateful. You've been very generous, and I can't thank you enough. The truck is no doubt worth more than my price,\" I said. \"I'm sorry, I just can't do that.\"\nUp he stood again. No smile now. Still befuddled. After a few seconds, he walked back to his manager and I leaned back. I could taste victory. A minute later-no eternity this time-he returned and sat. \"We can do that,\" he said. Two days later, I drove off in my Salsa Red Pearl Toyota 4Runner-for $30,000. God I love that truck. Still drive it today. Most negotiations hit that inevitable point where the slightly loose and informal interplay between two people turns to confrontation and the proverbial \"brass tacks.\" You know the moment: you've mirrored and labeled your way to a degree of rapport; an accusation audit has cleared any lingering mental or emotional obstacles, and you've identified and summarized the interests and positions at stake, eliciting a \"That's right,\" and . . . Now it's time to bargain. Here it is: the clash for cash, an uneasy dance of offers and counters that send most people into a cold sweat. If you count yourself among that majority, regarding the inevitable moment as nothing more than a necessary evil, there's a good chance you regularly get your clock cleaned by those who have learned to embrace it. No part of a negotiation induces more anxiety and unfocused aggression than bargaining, which is why it's the part that is more often fumbled and mishandled than any other. It's simply not a comfortable dynamic for most people. Even when we have the best-laid plans, a lot of us wimp out when we get to the moment of exchanging prices. In this chapter, I'm going to explain the tactics that make up the bargaining process, and look at how psychological dynamics determine which tactics should be used and how they should be implemented. Now, bargaining is not rocket science, but it's not simple intuition or mathematics, either. To bargain well, you need to shed your assumptions about the haggling process and learn to recognize the subtle psychological strategies that play vital roles at the bargaining table. Skilled bargainers see more than just opening offers, counteroffers, and closing moves. They see the psychological currents that run below the surface. Once you've learned to identify these currents, you'll be able to \"read\" bargaining situations more accurately and confidently answer the tactical questions that dog even the best negotiators. You'll be ready for the \"bare-knuckle bargaining.\" And they'll never see it coming. WHAT TYPE ARE YOU?",

You'll be ready for the \"bare-knuckle bargaining.\" And they'll never see it coming. WHAT TYPE ARE YOU? A few years ago I was on my boat with one of my employees, a great guy named Keenon; I was supposed to be giving him a pep talk and performance review. \"When I think of what we do, I describe it as 'uncovering the riptide,'\" I said. \"Uncovering the riptide,\" Keenon said. \"Yes, the idea is that we-you and I and everyone here-have the skills to identify the psychological forces that are pulling us away from shore and use them to get somewhere more productive.\"\n\"Somewhere more productive,\" Keenon said. \"Exactly,\" I said. \"To a place where we can . . .\"\nWe had talked for about forty-five minutes when my son Brandon, who runs operations for The Black Swan Group, broke out laughing. \"I can't take it anymore! Don't you see? Really, Dad, don't you see?\"\nI blinked. Did I see what? I asked him. \"All Keenon is doing is mirroring you. And he's been doing it for almost an hour.\"\n\"Oh,\" I said, my face going red as Keenon began to laugh. He was totally right. Keenon had been playing with me the entire time, using the psychological tool that works most effectively with assertive guys like me: the mirror. Your personal negotiation style-and that of your counterpart-is formed through childhood, schooling, family, culture, and a million other factors; by recognizing it you can identify your negotiating strengths and weaknesses (and those of your counterpart) and adjust your mindset and strategies accordingly. Negotiation style is a crucial variable in bargaining. If you don't know what instinct will tell you or the other side to do in various circumstances, you'll have massive trouble gaming out effective strategies and tactics. You and your counterpart have habits of mind and behavior, and once you identify them you can leverage them in a strategic manner. Just like Keenon did. There's an entire library unto itself of research into the archetypes and behavioral profiles of all the possible people you're bound to meet at the negotiating table. It's flat-out overwhelming, so much so that it loses its utility. Over the last few years, in an effort primarily led by my son Brandon, we've consolidated and simplified all that research, cross-referencing it with our experiences in the field and the case studies of our business school students, and found that people fall into three broad categories. Some people are Accommodators; others-like me-are basically Assertive; and the rest are data-loving Analysts. Hollywood negotiation scenes suggest that an Assertive style is required for effective bargaining, but each of the styles can be effective. And to truly be effective you need elements from all three. A study of American lawyer-negotiators\nfound that 65 percent of attorneys from two major U.S. cities used a cooperative style while only 24 percent were truly assertive. And when these lawyers were\ngraded for effectiveness, more than 75 percent of the effective group came from the cooperative type; only 12 percent were Assertive. So if you're not Assertive, don't despair. Blunt assertion is actually counterproductive most of the time. And remember, your personal negotiating style is not a straitjacket. No one is exclusively one style. Most of us have the capacity to throttle up our nondominant styles should the situation call for it. But there is one basic truth about a successful bargaining style: To be good, you have to learn to be yourself at the bargaining table. To be great you have to add to your strengths, not replace them. Here's a quick guide to classifying the type of negotiator you're facing and the tactics that will be most fitting for you. Analysts are methodical and diligent. They are not in a big rush. Instead, they believe that as long as they are working toward the best result in a thorough and systematic way, time is of little consequence. Their self-image is linked to minimizing mistakes. Their motto: As much time as it takes to get it right. Classic analysts prefer to work on their own and rarely deviate from their goals. They rarely show emotion, and they often use what is very close to the FM DJ Voice I talked about in Chapter 3, slow and measured with a downward inflection. However, Analysts often speak in a way that is distant and cold instead of soothing. This puts people off without them knowing it and actually limits them from putting their counterpart at ease and opening them up. Analysts pride themselves on not missing any details in their extensive preparation. They will research for two weeks to get data they might have gotten in fifteen minutes at the negotiating table, just to keep from being surprised. Analysts hate surprises. They are reserved problem solvers, and information aggregators, and are hypersensitive to reciprocity. They will give you a piece, but if\nthey don't get a piece in return within a certain period of time, they lose trust and will disengage. This can often seem to come out of nowhere, but remember, since they like working on things alone the fact that they are talking to you at all is, from their perspective, a concession. They will often view concessions by their counterpart as a new piece of information to be taken back and evaluated. Don't expect immediate counterproposals from them. People like this are skeptical by nature.",

They will often view concessions by their counterpart as a new piece of information to be taken back and evaluated. Don't expect immediate counterproposals from them. People like this are skeptical by nature. So asking too many questions to start is a bad idea, because they're not going to want to answer until they understand all the implications. With them, it's vital to be prepared. Use clear data to drive your reason; don't ad-lib; use data comparisons to disagree and focus on the facts; warn them of issues early; and avoid surprises. Silence to them is an opportunity to think. They're not mad at you and they're not trying to give you a chance to talk more. If you feel they don't see things the way you do, give them a chance to think first. Apologies have little value to them since they see the negotiation and their relationship with you as a person largely as separate things. They respond fairly well in the moment to labels. They are not quick to answer calibrated questions, or closed-ended questions when the answer is \"Yes.\" They may need a few days to respond. If you're an analyst you should be worried about cutting yourself off from an essential source of data, your counterpart. The single biggest thing you can do is to smile when you speak. People will be more forthcoming with information to you as a result. Smiling can also become a habit that makes it easy for you to mask any moments you've been caught off guard. ACCOMMODATOR\nThe most important thing to this type of negotiator is the time spent building the relationship. Accommodators think as long as there is a free-flowing continuous exchange of information time is\nbeing well spent. As long as they're communicating, they're happy. Their goal is to be on great terms with their counterpart. They love the win-win. Of the three types, they are most likely to build great rapport without actually accomplishing anything. Accommodators want to remain friends with their counterpart even if they can't reach an agreement. They are very easy to talk to, extremely friendly, and have pleasant voices. They will yield a concession to appease or acquiesce and hope the other side reciprocates. If your counterparts are sociable, peace-seeking, optimistic, distractible, and poor time managers, they're probably Accommodators. If they're your counterpart, be sociable and friendly. Listen to them talk about their ideas and use calibrated questions focused specifically on implementation to nudge them along and find ways to translate their talk into action. Due to their tendency to be the first to activate the reciprocity cycle, they may have agreed to give you something they can't actually deliver. Their approach to preparation can be lacking as they are much more focused on the person behind the table. They want to get to know you. They have a tremendous passion for the spirit of negotiation and what it takes not only to manage emotions but also to satisfy them. While it is very easy to disagree with an Accommodator, because they want nothing more that to hear what you have to say, uncovering their objections can be difficult. They will have identified potential problem areas beforehand and will leave those areas unaddressed out of fear of the conflict they may cause. If you have identified yourself as an Accommodator, stick to your ability to be very likable, but do not sacrifice your objections. Not only do the other two types need to hear your point of view; if you are dealing with another Accommodator they will welcome it. Also be conscious of excess chitchat: the other two types have no use for it, and if\nyou're sitting across the table from someone like yourself you will be prone to interactions where nothing gets done. The Assertive type believes time is money; every wasted minute is a wasted dollar. Their self-image is linked to how many things they can get accomplished in a period of time. For them, getting the solution perfect isn't as important as getting it done. Assertives are fiery people who love winning above all else, often at the expense of others. Their colleagues and counterparts never question where they stand because they are always direct and candid. They have an aggressive communication style and they don't worry about future interactions. Their view of business relationships is based on respect, nothing more and nothing less. Most of all, the Assertive wants to be heard. And not only do they want to be heard, but they don't actually have the ability to listen to you until they know that you've heard them. They focus on their own goals rather than people. And they tell rather than ask. When you're dealing with Assertive types, it's best to focus on what they have to say, because once they are convinced you understand them, then and only then will they listen for your point of view. To an Assertive, every silence is an opportunity to speak more. Mirrors are a wonderful tool with this type. So are calibrated questions, labels, and summaries. The most important thing to get from an Assertive will be a \"that's right\" that may come in the form of a \"that's it exactly\" or \"you hit it on the head.\"\nWhen it comes to reciprocity, this type is of the \"give an inch/take a mile\" mentality. They will have figured they deserve whatever you have given them so they will be oblivious to expectations of owing something in return. They will actually simply be looking for the opportunity to receive more.",

They will have figured they deserve whatever you have given them so they will be oblivious to expectations of owing something in return. They will actually simply be looking for the opportunity to receive more. If they have given some kind of concession, they are surely counting the seconds until they get something in return. If you are an Assertive, be particularly conscious of your tone. You will not intend to be overly harsh but you will often come off that way. Intentionally soften your tone and work to make it more pleasant. Use calibrated questions and labels with your counterpart since that will also make you more approachable and increase the chances for collaboration. We've seen how each of these groups views the importance of time differently (time = preparation; time = relationship; time = money). They also have completely different interpretations of silence. I'm definitely an Assertive, and at a conference this Accommodator type told me that he blew up a deal. I thought, What did you do, scream at the other guy and leave? Because that's me blowing up a deal. But it turned out that he went silent; for an Accommodator type, silence is anger. For Analysts, though, silence means they want to think. And Assertive types interpret your silence as either you don't have anything to say or you want them to talk. I'm one, so I know: the only time I'm silent is when I've run out of things to say. The funny thing is when these cross over. When an Analyst pauses to think, their Accommodator counterpart gets nervous and an Assertive one starts talking, thereby annoying the Analyst, who thinks to herself, Every time I try to think you take that as an opportunity to talk some more. Won't you ever shut up? Before we move on I want to talk about why people often fail to identify their counterpart's style. The greatest obstacle to accurately identifying someone else's style is what I call the \"I am normal\" paradox. That is, our hypothesis that the world should look to others as it looks to us. After all, who wouldn't make that assumption? But while innocent and understandable, thinking you're normal is one of the most damaging assumptions in negotiations. With it, we unconsciously project our own style on the other side. But with three types of negotiators in the world, there's a 66 percent chance your counterpart has a different style than yours. A different \"normal.\"\nA CEO once told me he expected nine of ten negotiations to fail. This CEO was likely projecting his beliefs onto the other side. In reality, he probably only matched with someone like-minded one of ten times. If he understood that his counterpart was different from him, he would most surely have increased his success rate. From the way they prepare to the way they engage in dialogue, the three types negotiate differently. So before you can even think about bargaining effectively, you have to understand your counterpart's \"normal.\" You have to identify their type by opening yourself to their difference. Because when it comes to negotiating, the Golden Rule is wrong. The Black Swan rule is don't treat others the way you want to be treated; treat them the way they need to be treated. (I've got a complementary PDF available that will help you identify your type and that of those around you. Please visit .blackswanltd.com/3-types.)\nTAKING A PUNCH\nNegotiation academics like to treat bargaining as a rational process devoid of emotion. They talk about the ZOPA-or Zone of Possible Agreement-which is where the seller's and buyer's zones cross. Say Tony wants to sell his car and won't take less than $5,000 and Samantha wants to buy but won't pay more than $6,000. The ZOPA runs from $5,000 to $6,000. Some deals have ZOPAs and some don't. It's all very rational. Or so they'd have you think. You need to disabuse yourself of that notion. In a real bargaining session, kick-ass negotiators don't use ZOPA. Experienced negotiators often lead with a ridiculous offer, an extreme anchor. And if you're not prepared to handle it, you'll lose your moorings and immediately go to your maximum. It's human nature. Like the great ear-biting pugilist Mike Tyson once said, \"Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.\"\nAs a well-prepared negotiator who seeks information and gathers it relentlessly, you're actually going to want the other guy to name a price first, because you want to see his hand. You're going to welcome the extreme anchor. But extreme anchoring is powerful and you're human: your emotions may well up. If they do there are ways to weather the storm without bidding against yourself or responding with anger. Once you learn these tactics, you'll be prepared to withstand the hit and counter with panache. First, deflect the punch in a way that opens up your counterpart. Successful negotiators often say \"No\" in one of the many ways we've talked about (\"How am I supposed to accept that?\") or deflect the anchor with questions like \"What are we trying to accomplish here?\" Responses like these are great ways to refocus your counterpart when you feel you're being pulled into the compromise trap. You can also respond to a punch-in-the-face anchor by simply pivoting to terms. What I mean by this is that when you feel you're being dragged into a haggle you can detour the conversation to the nonmonetary issues that make any final price work.",

You can do this directly by saying, in an encouraging tone of voice, \"Let's put price off to the side for a moment and talk about what would make this a good deal.\" Or you could go at it more obliquely by asking, \"What else would you be able to offer to make that a good price for me?\"\nAnd if the other side pushes\nto go first, wriggle from his grip. Instead of naming a price, allude to an incredibly high number that\nsomeone else might charge. Once when a hospital chain wanted me to name a price first, I said, \"Well, if you go to Harvard Business School, they're going to charge you $2,500 a day per student.\"\nNo matter what happens, the point here is to sponge up information from your counterpart. Letting your counterpart anchor first will give you a tremendous feel for him. All you need to learn is how to take the first punch. One of my Georgetown MBA students, a guy named Farouq, showed how not to fold after being punched when he went to hit up the MBA dean for funds to hold a big alumni event in Dubai. It was a desperate situation, because he needed $600 and she was his last stop. At the meeting, Farouq told the dean about how excited the students were about the trip and how beneficial it would be for the Georgetown MBA brand in the region. Before he could even finish, the dean jumped in. \"Sounds like a great trip you guys are planning,\" she said. \"But money is tight and I could authorize no more than $300.\"\nFarouq hadn't expected the dean to go so quickly. But things don't always go according to plan. \"That is a very generous offer given your budget limits, but I am not sure how that would help us achieve a great reception for the alums in the region,\" Farouq said, acknowledging her limits but saying no without using the word. Then he dropped an extreme anchor. \"I have a very high amount in my head: $1,000 is what we need.\"\nAs expected, the extreme anchor quickly knocked the dean off her limit. \"That is severely out of my range and I am sure I can't authorize that. However, I will give you $500.\"\nFarouq was half-tempted to fold-being $100 short wasn't make-or-break-but he remembered the curse of aiming low. He decided to push forward. The $500 got him closer to the goal but not quite there, he said; $850 would work. The dean replied by saying that she was already giving more than what she wanted and $500 was reasonable. At this point, if Farouq had been less prepared he would have given up, but he was ready for the punches. \"I think your offer is very reasonable and I understand your restrictions, but I need more money to put on a great show for the school,\" he said. \"How about $775?\"\nThe dean smiled, and Farouq knew he had her. \"You seem to have a specific number in your head that you are trying to get to,\" she said. \"Just tell it to me.\"\nAt that point Farouq was happy to give her his number as he felt she was sincere. \"I need $737.50 to make this work and you are my last stop,\" he said. She laughed. The dean then praised him for knowing what he wanted and said she'd check her budget. Two days later, Farouq got an email saying her office would put in $750. PUNCHING BACK: USING ASSERTION WITHOUT GETTING USED BY IT\nWhen a negotiation is far from resolution and going nowhere fast, you need to shake things up and get your counterpart out of their rigid mindset. In times like this, strong moves can be enormously effective tools. Sometimes a situation simply calls for you to be the aggressor and punch the other side in the face. That said, if you are basically a nice person, it will be a real stretch to hit the other guy like Mike Tyson. You can't be what you're not. As\nthe Danish folk saying goes, \"You bake with the flour you have.\" But anyone can learn a few tools. Here are effective ways to assert smartly:\nREAL ANGER, THREATS WITHOUT ANGER, AND STRATEGIC UMBRAGE\nMarwan Sinaceur of INSEAD and Stanford University's Larissa Tiedens found that expressions of anger increase a negotiator's advantage and final take. Anger shows passion and conviction that can help sway the other side to accept less. However, by heightening your counterpart's sensitivity to danger and fear, your anger reduces the resources they have for other cognitive activity, setting them up to make bad concessions that will likely lead to implementation problems, thus reducing your gains. Also beware: researchers have also found that disingenuous expressions of unfelt anger-you know, faking it-backfire, leading to intractable demands and destroying trust. For anger to be effective, it has to be real, the key for it is to be under control because anger also reduces our cognitive ability. And so when someone puts out a ridiculous offer, one that really pisses you off, take a deep breath, allow little anger, and channel it-at the proposal, not the person-and say, \"I don't see how that would ever work.\"\nSuch well-timed offense-taking-known as \"strategic umbrage\"-can wake your counterpart to the problem.",

In studies by Columbia University academics Daniel Ames and Abbie Wazlawek, people on the receiving end of strategic umbrage were more likely to rate themselves as\nassertive, even when the counterpart didn't think so. The real lesson here is being aware of how this might be used on\n. Please don't allow yourself to fall victim to \"strategic umbrage.\"\nThreats delivered without anger but with \"poise\"-that is, confidence and self-control-are great tools. Saying, \"I'm sorry that just doesn't work for me,\" with poise, works. \"WHY\" QUESTIONS\nBack in Chapter 7, I talked about the problems with \"Why?\" Across our planet and around the universe, \"Why?\" makes people defensive. As an experiment, the next time your boss wants something done ask him or her \"Why?\" and watch what happens. Then try it with a peer, a subordinate, and a friend. Observe their reactions and tell me if you don't find some level of defensiveness across the spectrum. Don't do this too much, though, or you'll lose your job and all your friends. The only time I say, \"Why did you do that?\" in a negotiation is when I want to knock someone back. It's an iffy technique, though, and I wouldn't advocate it. There is, however, another way to use \"Why?\" effectively. The idea is to employ the defensiveness the question triggers to get your counterpart to defend your position. I know it sounds weird, but it works. The basic format goes like this: When you want to flip a dubious counterpart to your side, ask them, \"Why would you do\n?\" but in a way that the \"\n\" favors you. Let me explain. If you are working to lure a client away from a competitor, you might say, \"Why would you ever do business with me? Why would you ever change from your existing supplier? They're great!\"\nIn these questions, the \"Why?\" coaxes your counterpart into working for you. \"I\" MESSAGES\nUsing the first-person singular pronoun is another great way to set a boundary without escalating into confrontation. When you say, \"I'm sorry, that doesn't work for me,\" the word \"I\" strategically focuses your counterpart's attention onto you long enough for you to make a point. The traditional \"I\" message is to use \"I\" to hit the pause button and step out of a bad dynamic. When you want to counteract unproductive statements from your counterpart, you can say, \"I feel ___ when you ___ because ___,\" and that demands a time-out from the other person. But be careful with the big \"I\": You have to be mindful not to use a tone that is aggressive or creates an argument. It's got to be cool and level. NO NEEDINESS: HAVING THE READY-TO-WALK MINDSET\nWe've said previously that no deal is better than a bad deal. If you feel you can't say \"No\" then you've taken yourself hostage. Once you're clear on what your bottom line is, you have to be willing to walk away. Never be needy for a deal. Before we move on, I want to emphasize how important it is to maintain a collaborative relationship even when you're setting boundaries. Your response must always be expressed in the form of strong, yet empathic, limit-setting boundaries-that is,\ntough love\n-not as hatred or violence. Anger and other strong emotions can on rare occasions be effective. But only as calculated acts, never a personal attack. In any bare-knuckle bargaining session, the most vital principle to keep in mind is never to look at your counterpart as an enemy. The person across the table is never the problem. The unsolved issue is. So focus on the issue. This is one of the most basic tactics for avoiding emotional escalations. Our culture demonizes people in movies and politics, which creates the mentality that if we only got rid of the person then everything would be okay. But this dynamic is toxic to any negotiation. Punching back is a last resort. Before you go there, I always suggest an attempt at de-escalating the situation. Suggest a time-out. When your counterparts step back and take a breath, they'll no longer\nfeel that they are hostage to a bad situation. They'll regain a sense of agency and power. And they'll appreciate you for that. Think of punching back and boundary-setting tactics as a flattened S-curve: you've accelerated up the slope of a negotiation and hit a plateau that requires you to temporarily stop any progress, escalate or de-escalate the issue acting as the obstacle, and eventually bring the relationship back to a state of rapport and get back on the slope. Taking a positive, constructive approach to conflict involves understanding that the bond is fundamental to any resolution. Never create an enemy. ACKERMAN BARGAINING\nI've spent a lot of time talking about the psychological judo that I've made my stock in trade: the calibrated questions, the mirrors, the tools for knocking my counterpart off his game and getting him to bid against himself. But negotiation still comes down to determining who gets which slice of the pie, and from time to time you're going to be forced into some real bare-knuckle bargaining with a hard-ass haggler. I faced bare-knuckle bargaining all the time in the hostage world. I haggled with a lot of guys who stuck to their game plan and were used to getting their way.",

But negotiation still comes down to determining who gets which slice of the pie, and from time to time you're going to be forced into some real bare-knuckle bargaining with a hard-ass haggler. I faced bare-knuckle bargaining all the time in the hostage world. I haggled with a lot of guys who stuck to their game plan and were used to getting their way. \"Pay or we'll kill,\" they'd say, and they meant it. You had to have your skills drum-tight to negotiate them down. You need tools. Back at FBI negotiation training, I learned the haggling system that I use to this day. And I swear by it. I call the system the Ackerman model because it came from this guy Mike Ackerman, an ex-CIA type who founded a kidnap-for-ransom consulting company based out of Miami. On many kidnappings we'd constantly be paired with \"Ackerman guys\"-never Mike himself-who helped design the haggle. After I retired from the FBI, I finally met Mike on a trip to Miami. When I told him I also used the system for business negotiations, he laughed and said he'd run the system by Howard Raiffa, a legendary Harvard negotiation guy, and Howard had said it would work in any situation. So I felt pretty justified by that. The Ackerman model is an offer-counteroffer method, at least on the surface. But it is a very effective system for beating the usual lackluster bargaining dynamic, which has the predictable result of meeting in the middle. The systematized and easy-to-remember process has only four steps:\nSet your target price (your goal). Set your first offer at 65 percent of your target price. Calculate three raises of decreasing increments (to 85, 95, and 100 percent). Use lots of empathy and different ways of saying \"No\" to get the other side to counter before you increase your offer. When calculating the final amount, use precise, nonround numbers like, say, $37,893 rather than $38,000. It gives the number credibility and weight. On your final number, throw in a nonmonetary item (that they probably don't want) to show you're at your limit. The genius of this system is that it incorporates the psychological tactics we've discussed-reciprocity, extreme anchors, loss aversion, and so on-without you needing to think about them. If you'll bear with me for a moment, I'll go over the steps so you see what I mean. First, the original offer of 65 percent of your target price will set an extreme anchor, a big slap in the face that might bring your counterpart\nright to their price limit. The shock of an extreme anchor will induce a fight-or-flight reaction in all but the most experienced negotiators, limiting their cognitive abilities and pushing them into rash action. Now look at the progressive offer increases to 85, 95, and 100 percent of the target price. You're going to drop these in sparingly: after the counterpart has made another offer on their end, and after you've thrown out a few calibrated questions to see if you can bait them into bidding against themselves. When you make these offers, they work on various levels. First, they play on the norm of reciprocity; they inspire your counterpart to make a concession, too. Just like people are more likely to send Christmas cards to people who first send cards to them, they are more likely to make bargaining concessions to those who have made compromises in their direction. Second, the diminishing size of the increases-notice that they decrease by half each time-convinces your counterpart that he's squeezing you to the point of breaking. By the time they get to the last one, they'll feel that they've really gotten every last drop. This really juices their self-esteem. Researchers have found that people getting concessions often feel better about the bargaining process than those who are given a single firm, \"fair\" offer. In fact, they feel better even when they end up paying more-or receiving less-than they otherwise might. Finally, the power of nonround numbers bears reiterating. Back in Haiti, I used to use the Ackerman system ferociously. Over eighteen months we got two or three kidnappings a week, so from experience, we knew the market prices were $15,000 to $75,000 per victim. Because I was a hard-ass, I made it my goal to get in under $5,000 in every kidnapping that I ran. One really stands out, the first one I mentioned in this book. I went through the Ackerman process, knocking them off their game with an extreme anchor, hitting them with calibrated questions, and slowly\ngave progressively smaller concessions. Finally, I dropped the weird number that closed the deal. I'll never forget the head of the Miami FBI office calling my colleague the next day and saying, \"Voss got this guy out for $4,751? How does $1 make a difference?\"\nThey were howling with laughter, and they had a point. That $1 is ridiculous. But it works on our human nature. Notice that you can't buy anything for $2, but you can buy a million things for $1.99. How does a cent change anything? It doesn't. But it makes a difference every time. We just like $1.99 more than $2.00 even if we know it's a trick. NEGOTIATING A RENT CUT AFTER RECEIVING NOTICE OF AN INCREASE\nEight months after a Georgetown MBA student of mine named Mishary signed a rental contract for $1,850/month, he got some unwelcome news: his landlord informed him that if he wanted to re-up, it would be $2,100/month for ten months, or $2,000/month for a year. Mishary loved the place and didn't think he'd find a better one, but the price was already high and he couldn't afford more.",

Mishary loved the place and didn't think he'd find a better one, but the price was already high and he couldn't afford more. Taking to heart our class slogan, \"You fall to your highest level of preparation,\" he dove into the real estate listings and found that prices for comparable apartments were $1,800-$1,950/month, but none of them were in as good a building. He then examined his own finances and figured the rent he wanted to pay was $1,830. He requested a sit-down with his rental agent. This was going to be tough. At their meeting, Mishary laid out his situation. His experience in the building had been really positive, he said. And, he pointed out, he always paid on time. It would be sad for him to leave, he said, and sad for the landlord to lose a good tenant. The agent nodded. \"Totally in agreement,\" he said. \"That's why I think it will benefit both of us to agree on renewing the lease.\"\nHere Mishary pulled out his research: buildings around the neighborhood were offering \"much\" lower prices, he said. \"Even though your building is better in terms of location and services,\nThe negotiation was on. The agent went silent for a few moments and then said, \"You make a good point, but this is still a good price. And as you noted, we can charge a premium.\"\nMishary then dropped an extreme anchor. \"I fully understand, you do have a better location and amenities. But I'm sorry, I just can't,\" he said. \"\n$1,730 a month\nThe agent laughed and when he finished said there was no way to accept that number, because it was way below market price. Instead of getting pulled into a haggle, Mishary smartly pivoted to calibrated questions. \"Okay, so please help me understand:\nThe agent didn't say anything shocking-merely that they used factors like area prices and supply-and-demand-but that gave Mishary the opening to argue that his leaving would open the landlord to the risk of having an unrented apartment and the cost of repainting. One month unrented would be a $2,000 loss, he said. Then he made another offer. Now, you're probably shaking your head that he's making two offers without receiving one in return. And you're right; normally that's verboten. But you have to be able to improvise. If you feel in control of a negotiation, you can do two or three moves at a time. Don't let the rules ruin the flow. \"Let me try and move along with you:\nThe agent paused. \"Sir, I understand your concerns, and what you said makes sense,\" he said. \"Your number, though, is very low. However, give me time to think this out and we can meet at another time. How does that sound?\"\nRemember, any response that is not an outright rejection means you have the edge. Five days later the two met again. \"I ran the numbers, and believe me this is a good deal,\" the agent started. \"I am able to offer you $1,950 a month for a year.\"\nMishary knew he'd won. The agent just needed a little push. So he praised the agent and said no without saying, \"No.\" And notice how he brilliantly mislabels in order to get the guy to open up? \"That is generous of you, but how am I supposed to accept it when I can move a few blocks away and stay for $1,800? A hundred and fifty dollars a month means a lot to me. You know I am a student. I don't know,\n\"It's not that,\" the agent answered. \"But I can't give you a number lower than the market.\"\nMishary made a dramatic pause, as if the agent was extracting every cent he had. \"Then I tell you what, I initially went up from $1,730 to $1,790,\" he said, sighing. \"I will bring it up to $1,810. And I think this works well for both.\"\nThe agent shook his head. \"This is still lower than the market, sir. And I cannot do that.\"\nMishary then prepared to give the last of his Ackerman offers. He went silent for a while and then asked the agent for a pen and paper. Then he started doing fake calculations to seem like he was really pushing himself. Finally, he looked up at the agent and said, \"I did some numbers, and the maximum I can afford is $1,829.\"\nThe agent bobbed his head from side to side, as if getting his mind around the offer. At last, he spoke. \"Wow. $1,829,\" he said. \"You seem very precise. You must be an accountant. [Mishary was not.] Listen, I value you wanting to renew with us and for that I think we can make this work for a twelve-month lease.\"\nKa-ching! Notice this brilliant combination of decreasing Ackerman offers, nonround numbers, deep research, smart labeling, and saying no without saying \"No\"? That's what gets you a rent\nwhen a landlord wanted to raise his monthly take.

So the next time you find yourself face-to-face with a bare-knuckle bargainer, remember the lessons in this chapter. Identify your counterpart's negotiating style. Once you know whether they are Accommodator, Assertive, or Analyst, you'll know the correct way to approach them. Prepare, prepare, prepare. When the pressure is on, you don't rise to the occasion; you fall to your highest level of preparation. So design an ambitious but legitimate goal and then game out the labels, calibrated questions, and responses\nyou'll use to get there. That way, once you're at the bargaining table, you won't have to wing it. Get ready to take a punch. Kick-ass negotiators usually lead with an extreme anchor to knock you off your game. If you're not ready, you'll flee to your maximum without a fight. So prepare your dodging tactics to avoid getting sucked into the compromise trap. Set boundaries, and learn to take a punch or punch back, without anger. The guy across the table is not the problem; the situation is. Prepare an Ackerman plan. Before you head into the weeds of bargaining, you'll need a plan of extreme anchor, calibrated questions, and well-defined offers. Remember: 65, 85, 95, 100 percent. Decreasing raises and ending on nonround numbers will get your counterpart to believe that he's squeezing you for all you're worth when you're really getting to the number",

      "text": "CHAPTER 10\nFIND THE BLACK SWAN\nt 11:30 a.m. on June 17, 1981, a beautiful 70-degree spring day with an insistent westerly breeze, thirty-seven-year-old William Griffin left the second-floor bedroom where he lived in his parent's Rochester, New York, home and trod down the shoe-buffed stairs that led to their meticulous living room. At the bottom he stopped, paused, and then, without a word of warning, shot off three shotgun blasts that killed his mother and a handyman who was hanging wallpaper and critically wounded his stepfather. The sound reverberated in the enclosed space. Griffin then left the house and shot a workman and two bystanders as he jogged two blocks to the Security Trust Company, a neighborhood bank. Seconds after he entered, people began sprinting from the bank as Griffin took nine bank employees hostage and ordered the customers to leave. For the next three and a half hours, Griffin led police and FBI agents in a violent standoff in which he shot and wounded the first two police officers who responded to the bank's silent alarm, and shot six people who happened to be walking near the bank. Griffin shot off so many rounds-more than one hundred in all-that\nthe police used a garbage truck to shield one officer as he was being rescued. Waving the nine bank employees into a small office at 2:30 p.m., Griffin told the manager to call the police and deliver a message. Outside, FBI agent Clint Van Zandt stood by while Rochester police officer Jim O'Brien picked up the phone. \"Either you come to the front entrance doors of the bank at three o'clock and have a shoot-out with him in the parking lot,\" the manager blurted through her tears, \"or he's going to start killing hostages and throwing out bodies.\"\nThen the line went dead. Now, never in the history of the United States had a hostage-taker killed a hostage on deadline. The deadline was always a way to focus the mind; what the bad guys really wanted was money, respect, and a helicopter. Everyone knew that. It was a permanent and inalterable\nknown known\n. It was the truth. But that permanent and inalterable truth was about to change. What came next showed the power of Black Swans, those hidden and unexpected pieces of information-those\nunknown unknowns-\nwhose unearthing has game-changing effects on a negotiation dynamic. Negotiation breakthroughs-when the game shifts inalterably in your favor-are created by those who can identify and utilize Black Swans. Here's how. FINDING LEVERAGE IN THE PREDICTABLY UNPREDICTABLE\nAt exactly 3 p.m., Griffin gestured toward one of his hostages, a twenty-nine-year-old teller named Margaret Moore, and told her to walk to the glass bank doors. Petrified, Moore did as she was ordered, but first cried out that she was a single parent with a young son. Griffin didn't seem to hear her, or to care. Once the weeping Moore made it to the vestibule, Griffin shot off two blasts from his twelve-gauge shotgun. Both of the heavy rounds struck Moore in the midsection, violently blowing her through the glass door and almost cutting her body in half. Outside, law enforcement was stunned into silence. It was obvious that Griffin didn't want money or respect or an escape route. The only way he was coming out was in a body bag. At that moment, Griffin walked over to a full-length bank window and pressed his body against the glass. He was in full view of a sniper stationed in the church across the street. Griffin knew quite well the sniper was there; earlier in the day he'd shot at him. Less than a second after Griffin's silhouette appeared in his scope, the sniper pulled the trigger. Griffin crumpled to the floor, dead. Black Swan theory tells us that things happen that were previously thought to be impossible-or never thought of at all. This is not the same as saying that sometimes things happen against one-in-a-million odds, but rather that things never imagined do come to pass. The idea of the Black Swan was popularized by risk analyst Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his bestselling books\nFooled by Randomness\nThe Black Swan\nbut the term goes back much further. Until the seventeenth century, people could only imagine white swans because all swans ever seen had possessed white feathers. In seventeenth-century London it was common to refer to impossible things as \"Black Swans.\"\nBut then the Dutch explorer Willem de Vlamingh went to western Australia in 1697-and saw a black swan. Suddenly the unthinkable and unthought was real. People had always predicted that the next swan they saw would be white, but the discovery of black swans shattered this worldview. Black Swans are just a metaphor, of course. Think of Pearl Harbor, the rise of the Internet, 9/11, and the recent banking crisis. None of the events above was predicted-yet on reflection, the markers were all there. It's just that people weren't paying attention. As Taleb uses the term, the Black Swan symbolizes the uselessness of predictions based on previous experience. Black Swans are events or pieces of knowledge that sit outside our regular expectations and therefore cannot be predicted. This is a crucial concept in negotiation. In every negotiating session, there are different kinds of information. There are those things we know, like our counterpart's name and their offer and our experiences from other negotiations. Those are\nknown knowns\n. There are those things we are certain that exist but we don't know, like the possibility that the other side might get sick and leave us with another counterpart. Those are\nknown unknowns\nand they are like poker wild cards; you know they're out there but you don't know who has them. But most important are those things we don't know that we don't know, pieces of information we've never imagined but that would be game changing if uncovered. Maybe our counterpart wants the deal to fail because he's leaving for a competitor. unknown unknowns\nare Black Swans.",

He did all of law enforcement a service by highlighting this event and he told me and a room full of agents the story of that horrible June day during a training session at Quantico. It was an introduction to the suicide-by-cop phenomenon-when an individual deliberately creates a crisis situation to provoke a lethal response from law enforcement-but there\nwas an even greater lesson at stake: the point of the story then, and now, was how important it is to recognize the unexpected to make sure things like Moore's death never happen again. On that day in June 1981, O'Brien kept calling the bank, but each time the bank employee who answered quickly hung up. It was at that moment they should have realized the situation was outside the\n. Hostage-takers\ntalked because they\nhad demands; they\nwanted to be heard, respected, and paid. But this guy didn't. Then, midway through the standoff, a police officer entered the command post with the news that a double homicide with a third person critically wounded had been reported a few blocks away. \"Do we need to know this?\" Van Zandt said. \"Is there a connection?\"\nNo one knew or found out in time. If they had, they might have uncovered a second Black Swan: that Griffin had already killed several people without making monetary demands. And then, a few hours in, the hostage-taker had one of the hostages read a note to the police over the phone. Curiously, there were no demands. Instead, it was a rambling diatribe about Griffin's life and the wrongs he'd endured. The note was so long and unfocused it was never read in its entirety. Because of this, one important line-another Black Swan-wasn't registered:\n\". . . after the police take my life . . .\"\nBecause these Black Swans weren't uncovered, Van Zandt and his colleagues never saw the situation for what it was: Griffin wanted to die, and he wanted the police to do it for him. Nothing like this-a shootout on a deadline?-had ever happened to the FBI, so they tried to fit the information into what had happened in the past. Into the old templates. They wondered, What does he\nwant? After scaring them for a bit, they expected Griffin to pick up the phone and start a dialogue. No one gets killed on deadline. Or so they thought. UNCOVERING UNKNOWN UNKNOWNS\nThe lesson of what happened at 3 p.m. on June 17, 1981, in Rochester, New York, was that when bits and pieces of a case don't add up it's usually because our frames of reference are off; they will never add up unless we break free of our expectations. Every case is new. We must let what we know-our\nknown knowns-\nguide us but not blind us to what we do not know; we must remain flexible and adaptable to any situation; we must always retain a beginner's mind; and we must never overvalue our experience or undervalue the informational and emotional realities served up moment by moment in whatever situation we face. But those were not the only important lessons of that tragic event. If an overreliance on\nknown knowns\ncan shackle a negotiator to assumptions that prevent him from seeing and hearing all that a situation presents, then perhaps an enhanced receptivity to the\nunknown unknowns\ncan free that same negotiator to see and hear the things that can produce dramatic breakthroughs. From the moment I heard the tale of June 17, 1981, I realized that I had to completely change how I approached negotiating. I began to hypothesize that in every negotiation each side is in possession of at least three Black Swans, three pieces of information that, were they to be discovered by the other side, would change everything. My experience since has proven this to be true. Now, I should note here that this is not just a small tweak to negotiation technique. It is not coincidence that I embraced Black Swan as the name of my company and the symbol of our approach. Finding and acting on Black Swans mandates a shift in your mindset. It takes negotiation from being a one-dimensional move-countermove game of checkers to a three-dimensional game that's more emotional, adaptive, intuitive . . . and truly effective. Finding Blacks Swans is no easy task, of course. We are all to some degree blind. We do not know what is around the corner until we turn it. By definition we do not know what we don't know. That's why I say that finding and understanding Black Swans requires a change of mindset. You have to open up your established pathways and embrace more intuitive and nuanced ways of listening. This is vital to people of all walks of life, from negotiators to inventors and marketers. What you don't know can kill you, or your deal. But to find it out is incredibly difficult. The most basic challenge is that people don't know the questions to ask the customer, the user . . . the counterpart.",

What you don't know can kill you, or your deal. But to find it out is incredibly difficult. The most basic challenge is that people don't know the questions to ask the customer, the user . . . the counterpart. Unless correctly interrogated, most people aren't able to articulate the information you want. The world didn't tell Steve Jobs that it wanted an iPad: he uncovered our need, that Black Swan, without us knowing the information was there. The problem is that conventional questioning and research techniques are designed to confirm\nknown knowns\nand reduce uncertainty. They don't dig into the unknown. Negotiations will always suffer from limited predictability. Your counterpart might tell you, \"It's a lovely plot of land,\" without mentioning that it is also a Superfund site. They'll say, \"Are the neighbors noisy? Well, everyone makes a bit of noise, don't they?\" when the actual fact is that a heavy metal band practices there nightly. It is the person best able to unearth, adapt to, and exploit the unknowns that will come out on top. To uncover these unknowns, we must interrogate our world, must put out a call, and intensely listen to the response. Ask lots of questions. Read nonverbal clues and always voice your observations with your counterpart. This is nothing beyond what you've been learning up to now. It is merely more intense and intuitive. You have to feel for the truth behind the camouflage; you have to note the small pauses that suggest discomfort and lies. Don't look to verify what you expect. If you\ndo, that's what you'll find. Instead, you must open yourself up to the factual reality that is in front of you. This is why my company changed its format for preparing and engaging in a negotiation. No matter how much research our team has done prior to the interaction, we always ask ourselves, \"Why are they communicating what they are communicating right now?\" Remember, negotiation is more like walking on a tightrope than competing against an opponent. Focusing so much on the end objective will only distract you from the next step, and that can cause you to fall off the rope. Concentrate on the next step because the rope will lead you to the end as long as all the steps are completed. Most people expect that Black Swans are highly proprietary or closely guarded information, when in fact the information may seem completely innocuous. Either side may be completely oblivious to its importance. Your counterpart always has pieces of information whose value they do not understand. THE THREE TYPES OF LEVERAGE\nI'm going to come back to specific techniques for uncovering Black Swans, but first I'd like to examine what makes them so useful. The answer is leverage. Black Swans are leverage multipliers. They give you the upper hand. Now, \"leverage\" is the magic word, but it's also one of those concepts that negotiation experts casually throw about but rarely delve into, so I'd like to do so here. In theory, leverage is the ability to inflict loss and withhold gain. Where does your counterpart want to gain and what do they fear losing? Discover these pieces of information, we are told, and you'll build leverage over the other side's perceptions, actions, and decisions. In practice, where our irrational perceptions are our reality, loss and\ngain are slippery notions, and it often doesn't matter what leverage actually exists against you; what really matters is the leverage they think you have on them. That's why I say there's always leverage: as an essentially emotional concept, it can be manufactured whether it exists or not. If they're talking to you, you have leverage. Who has leverage in a kidnapping? The kidnapper or the victim's family? Most people think the kidnapper has all the leverage. Sure, the kidnapper has something you love, but you have something they lust for. Which is more powerful? Moreover, how many buyers do the kidnappers have for the commodity they are trying to sell? What business is successful if there's only one buyer? Leverage has a lot of inputs, like time and necessity and competition. If you\nto sell your house\n, you have less leverage than if you don't have a deadline. If you\nto sell it but don't\nto, you have more. And if various people are bidding on it at once, good on you. I should note that leverage isn't the same thing as power. Donald Trump has tons of power, but if he's stranded in a desert and the owner of the only store for miles has the water he wants, the vendor has the leverage. One way to understand leverage is as a fluid that sloshes between the parties. As a negotiator you should always be aware of which side, at any given moment, feels they have the most to lose if negotiations collapse. The party who feels they have more to lose and are the most afraid of that loss has less leverage, and vice versa. To get leverage, you have to persuade your counterpart that they have something real to lose if the deal falls through. At a taxonomic level, there are three kinds: Positive, Negative, and Normative. POSITIVE LEVERAGE\nPositive leverage is quite simply your ability as a negotiator to provide-or withhold-things that your counterpart wants. Whenever\nthe other side says, \"I want . . .\" as in, \"I want to buy your car,\" you have positive leverage.",

POSITIVE LEVERAGE Positive leverage is quite simply your ability as a negotiator to provide-or withhold-things that your counterpart wants. Whenever the other side says, \"I want . . .\" as in, \"I want to buy your car,\" you have positive leverage. When they say that, you have power: you can make their desire come true; you can withhold it and thereby inflict pain; or you can use their desire to get a better deal with another party. Here's an example:\nThree months after you've put your business on the market, a potential buyer finally tells you, \"Yes, I'd like to buy it.\" You're thrilled, but a few days later your joy turns to disappointment when he delivers an offer so low it's insulting. This is the only offer you have, so what do you do? Now, hopefully you've had contact with other buyers, even casually. If you have, you can use the offer to create a sense of competition, and thereby kick off a bidding war. At least you'll force them to make a choice. But even if you don't have other offers or the interested buyer is your first choice, you have more power than before your counterpart revealed his desire. You control what they want. That's why experienced negotiators delay making offers-they don't want to give up leverage. Positive leverage should improve your psychology during negotiation. You've gone from a situation where you want something from the investor to a situation where you both want something from each other. Once you have it, you can then identify other things your opponent wants. Maybe he wants to buy your firm over time. Help him do that, if he'll increase the price. Maybe his offer is all the money he has. Help him get what he wants-your business-by saying you can only sell him 75 percent for his offer. NEGATIVE LEVERAGE\nNegative leverage is what most civilians picture when they hear the word \"leverage.\" It's a negotiator's ability to make his counterpart\nsuffer. And it is based on threats: you have negative leverage if you can tell your counterpart, \"If you don't fulfill your commitment/pay your bill/etc., I will destroy your reputation.\"\nThis sort of leverage gets people's attention because of a concept we've discussed:\nloss aversion. As effective negotiators have long known and psychologists have repeatedly proved, potential losses loom larger in the human mind than do similar gains. Getting a good deal may push us toward making a risky bet, but saving our reputation from destruction is a much stronger motivation. So what kind of Black Swans do you look to be aware of as negative leverage? Effective negotiators look for pieces of information, often obliquely revealed, that show what is important to their counterpart: Who is their audience? What signifies status and reputation to them? What most worries them? To find this information, one method is to go outside the negotiating table and speak to a third party that knows your counterpart. The most effective method is to gather it from interactions with your counterpart. That said, a word of warning: I do not believe in making direct threats and am extremely careful with even subtle ones. Threats can be like nuclear bombs. There will be a toxic residue that will be difficult to clean up. You have to handle the potential of negative consequences with care, or you will hurt yourself and poison or blow up the whole process. If you shove your negative leverage down your counterpart's throat, it might be perceived as you taking away their autonomy. People will often sooner die than give up their autonomy. They'll at least act irrationally and shut off the negotiation. A more subtle technique is to label your negative leverage and thereby make it clear without attacking. Sentences like \"It seems like you strongly value the fact that you've always paid on time\" or \"It seems like you don't care what position you are leaving me in\" can really open up the negotiation process. NORMATIVE LEVERAGE\nEvery person has a set of rules and a moral framework. Normative leverage is using the other party's norms and standards to advance your position. If you can show inconsistencies between their beliefs and their actions, you have normative leverage. No one likes to look like a hypocrite. For example, if your counterpart lets slip that they generally pay a certain multiple of cash flow when they buy a company, you can frame your desired price in a way that reflects that valuation. Discovering the Black Swans that give you normative valuation can be as easy as asking what your counterpart believes and listening openly. You want to see what language they speak, and speak it back to them. KNOW THEIR RELIGION\nIn March 2003 I led the negotiation with a farmer who became one of the most unlikely post-9/11 terrorists you can imagine. The drama started when Dwight Watson, a North Carolina tobacco grower, hooked up his jeep to a John Deere tractor festooned with banners and an inverted U.S. flag and towed it to Washington, D.C., to protest government policies he thought were putting tobacco farmers out of business. When Watson got to the capital, he pulled his tractor into a pond between the Washington Monument and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and threatened to blow it up with the \"organophosphate\" bombs he claimed were inside. The capital went into lockdown as the police blocked off an eight-block area from the Lincoln Memorial to the Washington Monument.",

The capital went into lockdown as the police blocked off an eight-block area from the Lincoln Memorial to the Washington Monument. Coming just months after the Beltway sniper attacks and alongside the buildup to the Iraq War, the ease with which Watson threw the nation's capital into turmoil freaked people out. Talking on his cell phone, Watson told the\nWashington Post\nthat he was on a do-or-die mission to show how reduced subsidies were killing tobacco farmers. He told the\nthat God had instructed him to stage his protest and he wasn't going to leave. \"If this is the way America will be run, the hell with it,\" he said. \"I will not surrender. They can blow [me] out of the water. I'm ready to go to heaven.\"\nThe FBI deployed me to a converted RV on the National Mall, where I was to guide a team of FBI agents and U.S. Park Police as we tried to talk Watson out of killing himself and who knows how many others. And then we got down to business. Like you'd expect of a negotiation with a guy threatening to destroy a good part of the U.S. capital, it was righteously tense. Sharpshooters had their weapons trained on Watson, and they had the \"green light\" to shoot if he made any crazy moves. In any negotiation, but especially in a tense one like this, it's not how well you speak but how well you listen that determines your success. Understanding the \"other\" is a precondition to be able to speak persuasively and develop options that resonate for them. There is the visible negotiation and then all the things that are hidden under the surface (the secret negotiation space wherein the Black Swans dwell). Access to this hidden space very often comes through understanding the other side's worldview, their\nreason for being\n, their religion. Indeed, digging into your counterpart's \"religion\" (sometimes involving God but not always) inherently implies moving beyond the negotiating table and into the life, emotional and otherwise, of your counterpart. Once you've understood your counterpart's worldview, you can build influence. That's why as we talked with Watson I spent my energy trying to unearth who he was rather than logically arguing him into surrender. From this we learned that Watson had been finding it increasingly hard to make a living on his 1,200-acre tobacco farm, which had been in his family for five generations. After being hit by a drought and having his crop quota cut by half, Watson decided he couldn't afford the farm anymore and drove to Washington to make his point. He wanted attention, and knowing what he wanted gave us positive leverage. Watson also told us he was a veteran, and veterans had rules. This is the kind of music you want to hear, as it provides normative leverage. He told us that he would be willing to surrender, but not right away. As a military police officer in the 82nd Airborne in the 1970s, he'd learned that if he was trapped behind enemy lines, he could withdraw with honor if reinforcements didn't arrive within three days. But not before. Now, we had articulated rules we could hold him to, and the admission that he could withdraw also implied that, despite his bluster about dying, he wanted to live. One of the first things you try to decide in a hostage negotiation is whether your counterpart's vision of the future involves them living. And Watson had answered yes. We used this information-a piece of negative leverage, as we could take away something he wanted: life-and started working it alongside the positive leverage of his desire to be heard. We emphasized to Watson that he had already made national news and if he wanted his message to survive he was going to have to live. Watson was smart enough to understand that there was a real chance he wouldn't make it out alive, but he still had his rules of military honor. His own desires and fears helped generate some positive and negative leverage, but they were secondary to the norms by which he lived his life. It was tempting to just wait until the third day, but I doubted we'd get that far. With each passing hour the atmosphere was growing tenser. The capital was under siege and we had reason to believe he\nmight have explosives. If he made one wrong move, one spastic freak-out, the snipers would kill him. He'd already had several angry outbursts, so every hour that passed endangered him. He could still get himself killed. But we couldn't hit on that at all; we couldn't threaten to kill him and expect that to work. The reason for that is something called the \"paradox of power\"-namely, the harder we push the more likely we are to be met with resistance. That's why you have to use negative leverage sparingly. Still, time was short and we had to speed things up. What happened next was one of those glorious examples of how deeply listening to understand your counterpart's worldview can reveal a Black Swan that transforms a negotiation dynamic. Watson didn't directly tell us what we needed to know, but by close attention we uncovered a subtle truth that informed everything he said. About thirty-six hours in, Winnie Miller, an FBI agent on our team who'd been listening intently to subtle references Watson had been making, turned to me. \"He's a devout Christian,\" she told me.",

Knowing your counterpart's religion is more than just gaining normative leverage per se. Rather, it's gaining a holistic understanding of your counterpart's worldview-in this case, literally a religion-and using that knowledge to inform your negotiating moves. Using your counterpart's religion is extremely effective in large part because it has authority over them. The other guy's \"religion\" is what the market, the experts, God, or society-whatever matters to him-has determined to be fair and just. And people defer to that authority. In the next conversation with Watson, we mentioned that the next morning was the Dawn of the Third Day. There was a long moment of silence on the other end of the line. Our Negotiation Operation Center was so quiet you could hear the heartbeat of the guy next to you. Watson coughed. \"I'll come out,\" he said. And he did, ending a forty-eight-hour standoff, saving himself from harm, and allowing the nation's capital to resume its normal life. No explosives were found. While the importance of \"knowing their religion\" should be clear from Watson's story, here are two tips for reading religion correctly:\nReview everything you hear. You will not hear everything the first time, so double-check. Compare notes with your team members. You will often discover new information that will help you advance the negotiation. Use backup listeners whose only job is to listen between the lines. They will hear things you miss. In other words: listen, listen again, and listen some more. We've seen how a holistic understanding of your counterpart's \"religion\"-a huge Black Swan-can provide normative leverage\nthat leads to negotiating results. But there are other ways in which learning your counterpart's \"religion\" enables you to achieve better outcomes. THE SIMILARITY PRINCIPLE\nResearch by social scientists has confirmed something effective negotiators have known for ages: namely, we trust people more when we view them as being similar or familiar. People trust those who are in their in-group. Belonging is a primal instinct. And if you can trigger that instinct, that sense that, \"Oh, we see the world the same way,\" then you immediately gain influence. When our counterpart displays attitudes, beliefs, ideas-even modes of dress-that are similar to our own, we tend to like and trust them more. Similarities as shallow as club memberships or college alumni status increase rapport. That's why in many cultures negotiators spend large amounts of time building rapport before they even think of offers. Both sides know that the information they glean could be vital to effective deal making and leverage building. It's a bit like dogs circling each other, smelling each other's behind. I once worked a deal for our services with this CEO in Ohio where the similarity principle played a major role. My counterpart was constantly making references that I recognized as being sort of born-again Christian material. As we talked he kept going back and forth on whether he should bring in his advisors. The whole issue of his advisors clearly pained him; at one point he even said, \"Nobody understands me.\"\nAt that moment I began to rack my brain for the Christian word that captured the essence of what he was saying. And then\nthe term came to my mind, a term people often used in church to describe the duty one had to administer our own and our world's-and therefore God's-resources with honesty, accountability, and responsibility. \"This is really stewardship for you, isn't it?\" I said. His voice immediately strengthened. \"Yes! You're the only one who understands,\" he said. And he hired us at that moment. By showing that I understood his deeper reasons for being and accessing a sense of similarity, of mutual belongingness, I was able to bring him to the deal. The minute I established a kind of shared identity with this Christian, we were in. Not simply because of similarity alone, but because of the understanding implied by that moment of similarity. THE POWER OF HOPES AND DREAMS\nOnce you know your counterpart's religion and can visualize what he truly wants out of life, you can employ those aspirations as a way to get him to follow you. Every engineer, every executive, every child-all of us want to believe we are capable of the extraordinary. As children, our daydreams feature ourselves as primary players in great moments: an actor winning an Oscar, an athlete hitting the game-winning shot. As we grow older, however, our parents, teachers, and friends talk more of what we can't and shouldn't do than what is possible. We begin to lose faith.",

As we grow older, however, our parents, teachers, and friends talk more of what we can't and shouldn't do than what is possible. We begin to lose faith. But when someone displays a passion for what we've always wanted and conveys a purposeful plan of how to get there, we allow our perceptions of what's possible to change. We're all hungry for a map to joy, and when someone is courageous enough to draw it for us, we naturally follow. So when you ascertain your counterpart's unattained goals, invoke your own power and follow-ability by expressing passion for their goals-and for their ability to achieve them. Ted Leonsis is great at this. As the owner of the Washington Wizards professional basketball team and the Washington Capitals professional hockey team, he is always talking about creating the immortal moments in sports that people will tell their grandchildren about. Who doesn't want to come to an agreement with someone who is going to make them immortal? RELIGION AS A REASON\nResearch studies have shown that people respond favorably to requests made in a reasonable tone of voice and followed with a \"because\" reason. In a famous study from the late 1970s,\nHarvard psychology professor Ellen Langer and her colleagues approached people waiting for copy machines and asked if they could cut the line. Sometimes they gave a reason; sometimes they didn't. What she found was crazy: without her giving a reason, 60 percent let her through, but when she did give one, more than 90 percent did. And it didn't matter if the reason made sense. (\"Excuse me, I have five pages. May I cut in line because I have to make copies?\" worked great.) People just responded positively to the framework. While idiotic reasons worked with something simple like photocopying, on more complicated issues you can increase your effectiveness by offering reasons that reference your counterpart's religion. Had that Christian CEO offered me a lowball offer when he agreed to hire my firm, I might have answered, \"I'd love to but I too have a duty to be a responsible steward of my resources.\"\nIT'S NOT CRAZY, IT'S A CLUE\nIt's not human nature to embrace the unknown. It scares us. When we are confronted by it, we ignore it, we run away, or we label it in ways that allow us to dismiss it. In negotiations, that label most often takes the form of the statement, \"They're crazy!\"\nThat's one reason I've been highly critical of some of the implementation of America's hostage negotiation policy-which is that we don't negotiate with those we refer broadly to as \"the Terrorists,\" including groups from the Taliban to ISIS. The rationale for this nonengagement is summarized well by the journalist Peter Bergen, CNN's national security analyst: \"Negotiations with religious fanatics who have delusions of grandeur generally do not go well.\"\nThe alternative we've chosen is to\nunderstand their religion, their fanaticism, and their delusions. Instead of negotiations that don't go well, we shrug our shoulders and say, \"They're crazy!\"\nBut that's absolutely wrongheaded. We must understand these things. I'm not saying that because I'm a softheaded pacifist (the FBI doesn't hire agents like that) but because I know understanding such things is the best way to discover the other side's vulnerabilities and wants and thereby gain influence. You can't get that stuff unless you talk. No one is immune to \"They're crazy!\" You can see it rear its head in every kind of negotiation, from parenting to congressional deal making to corporate bargaining. But the moment when we're most ready to throw our hands up and declare \"They're crazy!\" is often the best moment for discovering Black Swans that transform a negotiation. It is when we hear or see something that doesn't make sense-something \"crazy\"-that a crucial fork in the road is presented: push forward, even more forcefully,\ninto that which we initially can't process; or take the other path, the one to guaranteed failure, in which we tell ourselves that negotiating was useless anyway. In their great book\nNegotiation Genius\nHarvard Business School professors Deepak Malhotra and Max H. Bazerman provide a look at the common reasons negotiators mistakenly call their counterparts crazy. I'd like to talk through them here. MISTAKE #1: THEY ARE ILL-INFORMED\nOften the other side is acting on bad information, and when people have bad information they make bad choices. There's a great computer industry term for this: GIGO-Garbage In, Garbage Out. As an example, Malhotra talks about a student of his who was in a dispute with an ex-employee who claimed he was owed $130,000 in commissions for work he had done before being fired; he was threatening a lawsuit. Confused, the executive turned to the company's accountants. There he discovered the problem: the accounts had been a mess when the employee was fired but had since been put into order. With the clean information, the accountants assured the executive that in fact the employee owed the company $25,000. Eager to avoid a lawsuit, the executive called the employee, explained the situation, and made an offer: if the employee dropped the lawsuit he could keep the $25,000.

      "text": "the executive that in fact the employee owed the company $25,000. Eager to avoid a lawsuit, the executive called the employee, explained the situation, and made an offer: if the employee dropped the lawsuit he could keep the $25,000. To his surprise, the employee said that he was going forward with the suit anyway; he acted irrational, crazy. Malhotra told his student that the problem was not craziness, but a lack of information and trust. So the executive had an outside accounting firm audit the numbers and send the results to the employee. The result? The employee dropped the suit. The clear point here is that people operating with incomplete information appear crazy to those who have different information. Your job when faced with someone like this in a negotiation is to discover what they do not know and supply that information. MISTAKE #2: THEY ARE CONSTRAINED\nIn any negotiation where your counterpart is acting wobbly, there exists a distinct possibility that they have things they can't do but aren't eager to reveal. Such constraints can make the sanest counterpart seem irrational. The other side might not be able to do something because of legal advice, or because of promises already made, or even to avoid setting a precedent. Or they may just not have the power to close the deal. That last situation is one that a client of mine faced as he was trying to land Coca-Cola as a client for his marketing firm. The guy had been negotiating a deal for months and it was getting on to November. He was petrified that if he didn't close it before the calendar year ended he would have to wait for Coca-Cola to set a new budget and he might lose the client. The problem was that his contact had suddenly stopped responding. So we told him to send a version of our classic email for nonresponders, the one that\nworks: \"Have you given up on finalizing this deal this year?\"\nThen something weird happened. The Coca-Cola contact\nrespond to the perfect email. What was up? This was superficially quite irrational, but the contact had been a straight-up guy until then. We told our client this could mean only one thing: that the guy\ngiven up on closing the deal by the end of the year, but he didn't want to admit it. There had to be some constraint. With this knowledge in hand, we had our client dig deep. After a batch of phone calls and emails he tracked down someone who knew his contact. And it turned out we had been right: the contact's division had been in chaos for weeks, and in the midst of corporate infighting he had completely lost influence. Not surprisingly, he was embarrassed to admit it. That's why he was avoiding my client. To put it simply, he had major constraints. MISTAKE #3: THEY HAVE OTHER INTERESTS\nThink back to William Griffin, the first man ever to kill a hostage on deadline. What the FBI and police negotiators on the scene simply did not know was that his main interest was not negotiating a deal to release the hostages for money. He wanted to be killed by a cop. Had they been able to dig up that hidden interest, they might have been able to avoid some of that day's tragedy. The presence of hidden interests isn't as rare as you might think. Your counterpart will often reject offers for reasons that have nothing to do with their merits. A client may put off buying your product so that their calendar year closes before the invoice hits, increasing his chance for a promotion. Or an employee might quit in the middle of a career-making project, just before bonus season, because he or she has learned that colleagues are making more money. For that employee, fairness is as much an interest as money. Whatever the specifics of the situation, these people are not acting irrationally. They are simply complying with needs and desires that you don't yet understand, what the world looks like to them based on their own set of rules. Your job is to bring these Black Swans to light. As we've seen, when you recognize that your counterpart is not irrational, but simply ill-informed, constrained, or obeying interests that you do not yet know, your field of movement greatly expands. And that allows you to negotiate much more effectively. Here are a few ways to unearth these powerful Black Swans:\nGET FACE TIME\nBlack Swans are incredibly hard to uncover if you're not literally at the table. No matter how much research you do, there's just some information that you are not going to find out unless you sit face-to-face. Today, a lot of younger people do almost everything over email. It's just how things are done. But it's very difficult to find Black Swans with email for the simple reason that, even if you knock your counterpart off their moorings with great labels and calibrated questions, email gives them too much time to think and re-center themselves to avoid revealing too much. In addition, email doesn't allow for tone-of-voice effects, and it doesn't let you read the nonverbal parts of your counterpart's response (remember 7-38-55). Let's return now to the tale of my client who was trying to get Coca-Cola as a client, only to learn that his contact at the company had been pushed aside. I realized that the only way my client was going to get a deal with Coca-Cola was by getting his contact to admit that he was useless for the situation and pass my client on to the correct executive. But there was no way this guy wanted to do that, because he still imagined that he could be important. So I told my client to get his contact out of the Coca-Cola complex. \"You got to get him to dinner.",

But there was no way this guy wanted to do that, because he still imagined that he could be important. So I told my client to get his contact out of the Coca-Cola complex. \"You got to get him to dinner. You're going to say, 'Would it be a bad idea for me to take you to your favorite steak house and we just have a few laughs, and we don't talk business?'\"\nThe idea was that no matter the reason-whether the contact was embarrassed, or didn't like my client, or just didn't want to discuss the situation-the only way the process was going to move forward was through direct human interaction. So my client got this guy out for dinner and as promised he didn't bring up business. But there was no way not to talk about it, and just because my client created personal, face-to-face interaction, the contact admitted he was the wrong guy. He admitted that his division was a mess and he'd have to hand things off to somebody else to get the deal done. And he did. It took more than a year to get the deal signed, but they did it. OBSERVE UNGUARDED MOMENTS\nWhile you have to get face time, formal business meetings, structured encounters, and planned negotiating sessions are often the least revealing kinds of face time because these are the moments when people are at their most guarded. Hunting for Black Swans is also effective during unguarded moments at the fringes, whether at meals like my client had with his Coca-Cola contact, or the brief moments of relaxation before or after formal interactions. During a typical business meeting, the first few minutes, before you actually get down to business, and the last few moments, as everyone is leaving, often tell you more about the other side than anything in between. That's why reporters have a credo to never turn off their recorders: you always get the best stuff at the beginning and the end of an interview. Also pay close attention to your counterpart during interruptions, odd exchanges, or anything that interrupts the flow. When someone breaks ranks, people's fa\u00e7ades crack just a little. Simply noticing whose cracks and how others respond verbally and nonverbally can reveal a gold mine. WHEN IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE, THERE'S CENTS TO BE MADE\nStudents often ask me whether Black Swans are specific kinds of information or any kind that helps. I always answer that they are anything that you don't know that changes things. To drive this home, here's the story of one of my MBA students who was interning for a private equity real estate firm in Washington. Faced with actions from his counterpart that didn't pass the sense test, he innocently turned up one of the greatest Black Swans I've seen in years by using a label. My student had been performing due diligence on potential targets when a principal at the firm asked him to look into a mixed-use property in the heart of Charleston, South Carolina. He had no experience in the Charleston market, so he called the broker selling the property and requested the marketing package. After discussing the deal and the market, my student and his boss decided that the asking price of $4.3 million was about $450,000 too high. At that point, my student called the broker again to discuss pricing and next steps. After initial pleasantries, the broker asked my student what he thought of the property. \"It looks like an interesting property,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, we don't know the market fundamentals. We like downtown and King Street in particular, but we have a lot of questions.\"\nThe broker then told him that he had been in the market for more than fifteen years, so he was well informed. At this point, my student pivoted to\ncalibrated \"How\" and \"What\" questions\nin order to gather information and judge the broker's skills. \"Great,\" my student said. \"First and foremost, how has Charleston been affected by the economic downturn?\"\nThe broker replied with a detailed answer, citing specific examples\nof market improvement. In the process, he showed my student that he was very knowledgeable. \"It sounds like I'm in good hands!\" he said,\nusing a label to build empathy\n. \"Next question: What sort of cap rate can be expected in this type of building?\"\nThrough the ensuing back-and-forth, my student learned that owners could expect rates of 6 to 7 percent because buildings like this were popular with students at the local university, a growing school where 60 percent of the student body lived off campus. He also learned that it would be prohibitively expensive-if not physically impossible-to buy land nearby and build a similar building. In the last five years no one had built on the street because of historic preservation rules. Even if they could buy land, the broker said a similar building would cost $2.5 million just in construction. \"The building is in great shape, especially compared to the other options available to students,\" the broker said. \"It seems like this building functions more as a glorified dormitory than a classic multifamily building,\" my student said,\nusing a label to extract more information\nAnd he got it. \"Fortunately and unfortunately, yes,\" the broker said. \"The occupancy has historically been one hundred percent and it is a cash cow, but the students act like college students . . .\"\nA lightbulb went on in my student's head: there was something strange afoot.",

If it were such a cash cow,\nwhy would someone sell a 100 percent occupied building located next to a growing campus in an affluent city? That was irrational by any measure. A little befuddled but still in the negotiation mindset, my student constructed a label. Inadvertently he\nmislabeled the situation\n, triggering the broker to correct him and reveal a Black Swan. \"If he or she is selling such a cash cow, it seems like the seller must have doubts about future market fundamentals,\" he said. \"Well,\" he said, \"the seller has some tougher properties in Atlanta and Savannah, so he has to get out of this property to pay back the other mortgages.\"\nBingo! With that, my student had unearthed a fantastic\nBlack Swan\n. The seller was\nsuffering constraints\nthat, until that moment, had been unknown. My student put the broker on mute as he described other properties and used the moment to discuss pricing with his boss. He quickly gave him the green light to make a lowball offer-an extreme anchor-to try to yank the broker to his minimum. After quizzing the broker if the seller would be willing to close quickly, and getting a \"yes,\" my student set his anchor. \"I think I have heard enough,\" he said. \"We are willing to offer $3.4 million.\"\n\"Okay,\" the broker answered. \"That is well below the asking price. However, I can bring the offer to the seller and see what he thinks.\"\nLater that day, the broker came back with a counteroffer. The seller had told him that the number was too low, but he was willing to take $3.7 million. My student could barely keep from falling off his chair; the counteroffer was lower than his goal. But rather than jump at the amount-and risk leaving value on the table with a\nwimp-win deal\n-my student pushed further. He said \"No\" without using the word. \"That is closer to what we believe the value to be,\" he said, \"but we cannot in good conscience pay more than $3.55 million.\"\n(Later, my student told me-and I agreed-that he should have used a\nlabel or calibrated question\nhere to push the broker to bid against himself. But he was so surprised by how far the price had dropped that he stumbled into old-school haggling.)\n\"I am only authorized to go down to $3.6 million,\" the broker answered, clearly showing that he'd never taken a negotiation class that taught\nthe Ackerman model and how to pivot to terms to avoid the haggle. My student's boss signaled to him that $3.6 million worked and he agreed to the price. I've teased several of the techniques my student used to effectively negotiate a great deal for his firm, from\nthe use of labels and calibrated questions to the probing of constraints to unearth a beautiful Black Swan. It also bears noting that my student did tons of work beforehand and had prepared labels and questions so that he was ready to jump on the Black Swan when the broker offered it. Once he knew that the seller was trying to get money out of this building to pay off mortgages on the underperforming ones, he knew that timing was important. Of course, there's always room for improvement. Afterward my student told me he wished he hadn't lowballed the offer so quickly and instead used the opportunity to discuss the other properties. He might have found more investment opportunities within the seller's portfolio. In addition, he could have potentially built more\nand teased out more unknown unknowns with labels or calibrated questions like \"What markets are you finding difficult right now?\" Maybe even gotten\nface time with the seller directly\nStill, well done! OVERCOMING FEAR AND LEARNING TO GET WHAT YOU WANT OUT OF LIFE\nPeople generally fear conflict, so they avoid useful arguments out of fear that the tone will escalate into personal attacks they cannot handle. People in close relationships often avoid making their own interests known and instead compromise across the board to avoid being perceived as greedy or self-interested. They fold, they grow bitter, and they grow apart. We've all heard of marriages that ended in divorce and the couple never fought. Families are just an extreme version of all parts of humanity, from government to business. Except for a few naturals, everyone hates negotiation at first. Your hands sweat, your fight-or-flight kicks in (with a strong emphasis on\n), and your thoughts trip drunkenly over themselves. The natural first impulse for most of us is to chicken out, throw in the towel, run. The mere idea of tossing out an extreme anchor is traumatic. That's why wimp-win deals are the norm in the kitchen and in the boardroom. But stop and think about that. Are we\nafraid of the guy across the table? I can promise you that, with very few exceptions, he's not going to reach across and slug you. No, our sweaty palms are just an expression of physiological fear, a few trigger-happy neurons firing because of something more base: our innate human desire to get along with other members of the tribe. It's not the guy across the table who scares us: it's conflict itself. If this book accomplishes only one thing, I hope it gets you over that fear of conflict and encourages you to navigate it with empathy.",

No, our sweaty palms are just an expression of physiological fear, a few trigger-happy neurons firing because of something more base: our innate human desire to get along with other members of the tribe. It's not the guy across the table who scares us: it's conflict itself. If this book accomplishes only one thing, I hope it gets you over that fear of conflict and encourages you to navigate it with empathy. If you're going to be great at anything-a great negotiator, a great manager, a great husband, a great wife-you're going to have to do that. You're going to have to ignore that little genie who's telling you to give up, to just get along-as well as that other genie who's telling you to lash out and yell. You're going to have to embrace regular, thoughtful conflict as the basis of effective negotiation-and of life. Please remember that our emphasis throughout the book is that the adversary is the situation and that the person that you appear to be in conflict with is actually your partner. More than a little research has shown that genuine, honest conflict between people over their goals actually helps energize the problem-solving process in a collaborative way. Skilled negotiators have a talent for using conflict to keep the negotiation going without stumbling into a personal battle. Remember, pushing hard for what you believe is not selfish. It is not bullying. It is not just helping you. Your amygdala, the part of the brain that processes fear, will try to convince you to give up, to flee, because the other guy is right, or you're being cruel. But if you are an honest, decent person looking for a reasonable outcome, you can ignore the amygdala. With the style of negotiation taught in the book-an information-obsessed, empathic search for the best possible deal-you are trying to uncover value, period. Not to strong-arm or to humiliate. When you ask calibrated questions, yes, you are leading your counterpart to your goals. But you are also leading them to examine and articulate what they want and why and how they can achieve it. You are demanding creativity of them, and therefore pushing them toward a collaborative solution. When I bought my red 4Runner, no doubt I disappointed the salesman by giving him a smaller payday than he would have liked. But I helped him reach his quota, and no doubt I paid more for the truck than the car lot had paid Toyota. If all I'd wanted was to \"win,\" to humiliate, I would have stolen the thing. And so I'm going to leave you with one request: Whether it's in the office or around the family dinner table, don't avoid honest, clear conflict. It will get you the best car price, the higher salary, and the largest donation. It will also save your marriage, your friendship, and your family. One can only be an exceptional negotiator, and a great person, by both listening and speaking clearly and empathetically; by treating counterparts-and oneself-with dignity and respect; and most of all by being honest about what one wants and what one can-and cannot-do. Every negotiation, every conversation, every moment of life, is a series of small conflicts that, managed well, can rise to creative beauty. Embrace them. KEY LESSONS\nWhat we don't know can kill us or our deals. But uncovering it can totally change the course of a negotiation and bring us unexpected success. Finding the Black Swans-those powerful\nunknown unknowns\n-is intrinsically difficult, however, for the simple reason that we don't know the questions to ask. Because we don't know what the treasure is, we don't know where to dig. Here are some of the best techniques for flushing out the Black Swans-and exploiting them. Remember, your counterpart might not even know how important the information is, or even that they shouldn't reveal it. So keep pushing, probing, and gathering information. Let what you know-your\nknown knowns-\nguide you but not blind you. Every case is new, so remain flexible and adaptable. Remember the Griffin bank crisis: no hostage-taker had killed a hostage on deadline, until he did. Black Swans are leverage multipliers. Remember the three types of leverage: positive (the ability to give someone what they want); negative (the ability to hurt someone); and normative (using your counterpart's norms to bring them around). Work to understand the other side's \"religion.\" Digging into worldviews inherently implies moving beyond the negotiating table and into the life, emotional and otherwise, of your counterpart. That's where Black Swans live. Review everything you hear from your counterpart. You will not hear everything the first time, so double-check. Compare notes with team members. Use backup listeners whose\njob is to listen between the lines. They will hear things you miss. Exploit the similarity principle. People are more apt to concede to someone they share a cultural similarity with, so dig for what makes them tick and show that you share common ground. When someone seems irrational or crazy, they most likely aren't. Faced with this situation, search for constraints, hidden desires, and bad information. Get face time with your counterpart. Ten minutes of face time often reveals more than days of research. Pay special attention to your counterpart's verbal and nonverbal communication at unguarded moments-at the beginning and the end of the session or when someone says something out of line.",

      "text": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nhis book would not have been possible without my son Brandon's help. Brandon has been involved in helping me shape and create these ideas since I first began teaching at Georgetown University. He was initially just there to video-record the classes but he also provided me feedback on how it was going and what was working. To be fair, he actually has been negotiating with me since he was two years old. I think I've known that ever since I found out he was using empathy to get out of trouble with his vice-principal in high school. In my first meeting with my brilliant cowriter, Tahl Raz, Brandon was there to keep the information flow going as Tahl soaked it up. In the first progress conference call with my amazing publisher, Hollis Heimbouch, Hollis asked about Brandon's role and Tahl said having Brandon around was like having another Chris in the room. Brandon has been indispensable.\nTahl Raz is a flat-out genius. Anyone who writes a business book without him hasn't gotten as far as they could have. It's that simple. I can't believe how smart he is or how quickly he gets it. He is a true business-writing artist. He's a great person as well.\nSteve Ross, my agent, is a man of integrity and was perfect for this book. He has great industry knowledge and made this book happen. I am grateful to know him.\nHollis Heimbouch rocks! I am thrilled that she led the HarperCollins team and believed enough in this book to buy it. Thank you, Hollis.\nThank you, Maya Stevenson, for coming onto the Black Swan team and holding us together. We are going farther because of you.\nSheila Heen and John Richardson are two amazing people. They are the ones who really paved the way to show that these hostage negotiation ideas belong in the business world. Sheila was my teacher at Harvard Law School. She inspired me with how she taught and who she is. She asked me to teach alongside her two years later. John asked me to teach International Business Negotiation at Harvard alongside him a year after that. He guided me through that process, which led to the opportunity to become an adjunct at Georgetown. When nothing was happening for me, both John and Sheila were there. Without them I don't know where I'd be. Thank you both.\nGary Noesner was my mentor at the FBI. He inspired and remade the hostage negotiation world (with the help of his team at the Crisis Negotiation Unit-CNU). He supported me in whatever I wanted to do. He made me the FBI's lead international kidnapping negotiator. I could call Gary at five a.m. and tell him I was getting on a plane in three hours to go to a kidnapping and he would say, \"Go.\" His support never wavered. At CNU he pulled together the most talented collection of hostage negotiators ever assembled. CNU hit its zenith when we were there. None of us knew how lucky we were. John Flood, Vince Dalfonzo, Chuck Regini, Winnie Miller, Manny Suarez, Dennis Braiden, Neil Purtell, and Steve Romano were all rock stars. I learned from you all. I can't believe what Chuck put up with from me as my partner. Dennis was a mentor and great friend. I constantly clashed with Vince and grew because of his talent.\nAll those who were on the FBI Critical Incident Negotiation Team during that time taught me as well. Thank you.\nTommy Corrigan and John Liguori were my brothers when I was in New York City. The three of us did extraordinary things together. I am\ninspired by the memory of Tommy Corrigan to this day. I was privileged to be a member of the Joint Terrorist Task Force. We fought evil. Richie DeFilippo and Charlie Beaudoin were exceptional wingmen on the Crisis Negotiation Team. Thank you both for all you taught me.\nHugh McGowan and Bob Louden from the NYPD's Hostage Negotiation Team shared their wisdom with me. Both of you have been indispensable assets to the hostage negotiation world. Thank you.\nDerek Gaunt has been a great wingman in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. Derek gets it. Thank you, Derek. Kathy Ellingsworth and her late husband, Bill, have been dear friends and a sounding board for years. I am grateful for your support and friendship.\nTom Strentz is the godfather of the FBI's hostage/crisis negotiation program and has been an unwavering friend. I can't believe he still takes my calls.\nMy students at Georgetown and USC have constantly proved that these ideas work everywhere. More than one student has stopped breathing when I looked at them and said, \"I need a car in sixty seconds or she dies.\" Thanks for coming along for the ride. Georgetown and USC have both been phenomenal places to teach. Both are truly dedicated to higher learning, the highest academic standards, and the success of their students.\nThe hostages and their families who allowed me in during their darkest hours to try to help are all blessed people. I am grateful to still be in touch with some of you today. What wisdom there is in the universe that decided your paths were necessary, I don't understand. I was blessed by your grace.

      "text": "PREPARE A NEGOTIATION ONE SHEET\negotiation is a psychological investigation. You can gain a measure of confidence going into such an investigation with a simple preparatory exercise we advise all our clients to do. Basically, it's a list of the primary tools you anticipate using, such as labels and calibrated questions, customized to the particular negotiation. When the pressure is on, you don't rise to the occasion-you fall to your highest level of preparation. One note of caution before going into greater depth on this exercise: some negotiation experts fetishize preparation to such a degree that they advise people to create the equivalent of preordained scripts for exactly how the negotiation will unfold and the exact form and substance the agreement will take on. By now, after reading this far, you'll understand why that's a fool's errand. Not only will such an approach make you less agile and creative at the table, it will make you more susceptible to those who are. Based on my company's experiences, I believe that good initial preparation for each negotiation yields at least a 7:1 rate of return on time saved renegotiating deals or clarifying implementation. In the entertainment industry, they have a single document that summarizes a product for publicity and sales that they call a \"one\nsheet.\" Along the same lines, we want to produce a negotiation \"one sheet\" that summarizes the tools we are going to use. It will have five short sections\nSECTION I: THE GOAL\nThink through best/worst-case scenarios but only write down a specific goal that represents the best case. Typically, negotiation experts will tell you to prepare by making a list: your bottom line; what you really want; how you're going to try to get there; and counters to your counterpart's arguments. But this typical preparation fails in many ways. It's unimaginative and leads to the predictable bargaining dynamic of offer/counteroffer/meet in the middle. In other words, it gets results, but they're often mediocre. The centerpiece of the traditional preparation dynamic-and its greatest Achilles' heel-is something called the BATNA. Roger Fisher and William Ury coined the term in their 1981 bestseller,\nGetting to Yes\n, and it stands for Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement. Basically, it's the best possible option you have if negotiations fail. Your last resort. Say you're on a car lot trying to sell your old BMW 3-series. If you already have another dealer who's given you a written offer for $10,000, that's your BATNA. The problem is that BATNA tricks negotiators into aiming low. Researchers have found that humans have a limited capacity for keeping focus in complex, stressful situations like negotiations. And so, once a negotiation is under way, we tend to gravitate toward the focus point that has the most psychological significance for us. In that context, obsessing over a BATNA turns it into your target, and thereby sets the upper limit of what you will ask for. After you've spent hours on a BATNA, you mentally concede everything beyond it. God knows aiming low is seductive. Self-esteem is a huge factor in negotiation, and many people set modest goals to protect it. It's easier to claim victory when you aim low. That's why some negotiation experts say that many people who think they have \"win-win\" goals really have a \"wimp-win\" mentality. The \"wimp-win\" negotiator focuses on his or her bottom line, and that's where they end up. So if BATNA isn't your centerpiece, what should be? I tell my clients that as part of their preparation they should think about the outcome extremes: best\nworst. If you've got both ends covered, you'll be ready for anything. So know what you cannot accept and have an idea about the best-case outcome, but keep in mind that since there's information yet to be acquired from the other side, it's quite possible that best case might be even better than you know. Remember, never be so sure of what you want that you wouldn't take something better. Once you've got flexibility in the forefront of your mind you come into a negotiation with a winning mindset. Let's say you're selling old speakers because you need $100 to put toward a new set. If you concentrate on the $100 minimum, you'll relax when you hear that number and that's what you'll get. But if you know that they are for sale in used audio stores for $140, you could set a high-end goal of $150, while remaining open to better things. Now, while I counsel thinking about a best/worst range to give my clients the security of some structure, when it comes to what actually goes on your one sheet, my advice is to just stick with the high-end goal, as it will motivate and focus your psychological powers, priming you to think you are facing a \"loss\" for any term that falls short. Decades of goal-setting research is clear that people who set specific, challenging, but realistic goals end up getting better deals than those who don't set goals or simply strive to do their best. Bottom line: People who expect more (and articulate it) get more. Here are the four steps for setting your goal:\nSet an optimistic but reasonable goal and define it clearly. Write it down. Discuss your goal with a colleague (this makes it harder to wimp out). Carry the written goal into the negotiation. SECTION II: SUMMARY\nSummarize and write out in just a couple of sentences the known facts that have led up to the negotiation. You're going to have to have something to talk about beyond a self-serving assessment of what you want. And you had better be ready to respond with tactical empathy to your counterpart's arguments; unless they're incompetent, the other party will come prepared to argue an interpretation of the facts that favors them. Get on the same page at the outset. You have to clearly describe the lay of the land before you can think about acting in its confines.",

      "text": "SUMMARY Summarize and write out in just a couple of sentences the known facts that have led up to the negotiation. You're going to have to have something to talk about beyond a self-serving assessment of what you want. And you had better be ready to respond with tactical empathy to your counterpart's arguments; unless they're incompetent, the other party will come prepared to argue an interpretation of the facts that favors them. Get on the same page at the outset. You have to clearly describe the lay of the land before you can think about acting in its confines. Why are you there? What do you want? What do they want? Why? You must be able to summarize a situation in a way that your counterpart will respond with a \"That's right.\" If they don't, you haven't done it right. SECTION III: LABELS/ACCUSATION AUDIT\nPrepare three to five labels to perform an accusation audit. Anticipate how your counterpart feels about these facts you've just summarized. Make a concise list of any accusations they might\nmake-no matter how unfair or ridiculous they might be. Then turn each accusation into a list of no more than five labels and spend a little time role-playing it. There are fill-in-the-blank labels that can be used in nearly every situation to extract information from your counterpart, or defuse an accusation:\nIt seems like _________ is valuable to you. It seems like you don't like _________. It seems like you value __________. It seems like _________ makes it easier. It seems like you're reluctant to _________. As an example, if you're trying to renegotiate an apartment lease to allow subletters and you know the landlord is opposed to them, your prepared labels would be on the lines of \"It seems as though you're not a fan of subletters\" or \"It seems like you want stability with your tenants.\"\nSECTION IV: CALIBRATED QUESTIONS\nPrepare three to five calibrated questions to reveal value to you and your counterpart and identify and overcome potential deal killers. Effective negotiators look past their counterparts' stated positions (\nthe party demands) and delve into their underlying motivations (\nis making them want what they want). Motivations are what they are worried about and what they hope for, even lust for. Figuring out what the other party is worried about sounds simple, but our basic human expectations about negotiation often get in the way. Most of us tend to assume that the needs of the other side conflict with our own. We tend to limit our field of vision to our issues and problems, and forget that the other side has its own unique issues based on its own unique worldview. Great negotiators get past these\nblinders by being relentlessly curious about what is\nmotivating the other side. Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling has a great quote that sums up this concept: \"You must accept the reality of other people. You think that reality is up for negotiation, that we think it's whatever you say it is. You must accept that we are as real as you are; you must accept that you are not God.\"\nThere will be a small group of \"What\" and \"How\" questions that you will find yourself using in nearly every situation. Here are a few of them:\nWhat are we trying to accomplish? How is that worthwhile? What's the core issue here? How does that affect things? What's the biggest challenge you face? How does this fit into what the objective is? QUESTIONS TO IDENTIFY BEHIND-THE-TABLE DEAL KILLERS\nWhen implementation happens by committee, the support of that committee is key. You'll want to tailor your calibrated questions to identify and unearth the motivations of those behind the table, including:\nHow does this affect the rest of your team? How on board are the people not on this call? What do your colleagues see as their main challenges in this area? QUESTIONS TO IDENTIFY AND DIFFUSE DEAL-KILLING ISSUES\nInternal negotiating influence often sits with the people who are most comfortable with things as they are. Change may make them look as if they haven't been doing their job. Your dilemma in such a negotiation is how to make them look good in the face of that change. You'll be tempted to concentrate on money, but put that aside for now. A surprisingly high percentage of negotiations hinge on something outside dollars and cents. Often they have more to do with self-esteem, status, autonomy, and other nonfinancial needs. Think about their perceived losses. Never forget that a loss stings at least twice as much as an equivalent gain. For example, the guy across the table may be hesitating to install the new accounting system he needs (and you are selling) because he doesn't want to screw anything up before his annual review in four months' time. Instead of lowering your price, you can offer to help impress his boss, and do it safely, by promising to finish the installation in ninety days, guaranteed. QUESTIONS TO USE TO UNEARTH THE DEAL-KILLING ISSUES\nWhat are we up against here? What is the biggest challenge you face? How does making a deal with us affect things? What happens if you do nothing? What does doing nothing cost you? How does making this deal resonate with what your company prides itself on? It's often very effective to ask these in groups of two or three as they are similar enough that they help your counterpart think about the same thing from different angles. Every situation is unique, of course, but choosing the right mix of these questions will lead your counterpart to reveal information about what they want and need-and simultaneously push them to see things from your point of view. Be ready to execute follow-up labels to their answers to your calibrated questions. Having labels prepared will allow you to quickly turn your\ncounterpart's responses back to them, which will keep them feeding you new and expanding information.",

Again, these are fill-in-the-blank labels that you can use quickly without tons of thought:\nIt seems like __________ is important. It seems you feel like my company is in a unique position to __________. It seems like you are worried that __________. SECTION V: NONCASH OFFERS\nPrepare a list of noncash items possessed by your counterpart that would be valuable. Ask yourself: \"What could they give that would almost get us to do it for free?\" Think of the anecdote I told a few chapters ago about my work for the lawyers' association: My counterpart's interest was to pay me as little cash as possible in order to look good in front of his board. We came upon the idea that they pay in part by publishing a cover story about me in their magazine. That was low-cost for them and it advanced my interests considerably.

One option is to break longer forms up into separate forms, but being able to do this at the section level or even the question level would allow much more customization that would streamline things like detailed site surveys.\nWork (WOs, Forms,\u2026\nRemove old emails from feed\nLooking to remove old emails from the feed if they aren't relevant to the project.\nProject Page\nCollapsible Forms\nForms can get very long (ex. detailed site survey), would be nice to be able to expand one section of the form at a time for easier navigation.\nWork (WOs, Forms,\u2026\nAdd file attachments to automation emails\nIt would be really helpful if automation emails could include custom attachments (PDFs/images), not only \u201cSend forms added to work order as attachment.\u201d\nAutomations\nMore options with Automations\nThere are editable features in coperniq that have no way of being automated at the moment. For example, I would like to create a trigger based on when a visit date is updated but this is currently not an option. I would also like forms to be automatically created without attaching it to a work order but it is also not an option. Is there a way we can make automations more versatile?\nWork (WOs, Forms,\u2026\nAdd \"Today\" date option for automations.\nWHAT: Right now the only date option \"effect\" or \"then\" for the conditional logic in automations is \"if this happens then fill said date field with [specific date]\" but there is no fill with [today's date]... so of course that is useless because we would never want to fill a specific pre-determined date but rather the date something has occurred. WHY: Since the way Coperniq is designed now, we need separate work orders for each workflow if we want to add attached automations that vary per workflow or different auto-assignees for different workflows, etc., so when we need to export reports for multiple workflows, or multiple duplicated WOs' completed dates, we would have to have different columns for each one, this could be many columns for basically the same date. (ex. when the \"electrical construction\" WO has been completed for Oahu, BI, Maui, etc. as each one needs a different WO since there is no conditional logic for WOs or forms based on workflows, or if we base it on phases, each WO has its own phase even if it's the same stage.) HOW: We can get around this by adding conditional logic to automations with a \"mark as today\" date for any specific action, such as \"when Electrical Construction WO is marked complete, fill Electrical Completed On field with today's date\" (meaning obviously that day's date). Or \"when Construction phase is marked complete, fill Construction Complete date field with today's date.\" Since we can resue the fields for all projects, we could then use this date field that would be auto filled at various times for every WO/workflow, we only need to have one column, not many, to indicate the same date across all projects/workflows.\nAutomations\nDaily Completion Form\nFor multiple day/week jobs like commercial, it would be nice to have a feature that automatically assigned \"daily completion form\" to Installation Lead or PM. We are currently manually doing this. Adding form in construction phase each day. It would also be nice to have that automatically emailed once completed, instead of manually extracting it. I am unaware of a way to set this automation since it is just a form within a WO.\nReuse Form Questions and Sections\nEx. some homes have 2 types of roof. for each type, I want the surveyor to fill in 10 questions. Rather than rebuild these questions with same dropdowns, and maintain two copies, it would be great to be able to drop in a form section template. If I went the route of creating a standalone form, then I'd have to duplicate it (and maintain 2 copies) in order to use both in the same project workflow. Would be awesome to be able to save a form question and a form section as templates, and reuse them multiple times within a form as well as across forms.\nWork (WOs, Forms,\u2026\nDate in Forms\nIt would be great to have a DATE option as a form option other than a project property where you can add the date from a calendar vs typing in the date.\nWork (WOs, Forms,\u2026\nIntegration with Google Suite\nI would like a platform that can integrate with Google Suite, including Google Calendar. This would help me manage my schedules and communications more effectively.\nLoad More\nPowered\u00a0by\u00a0Canny",

Now the work orders are stationary and immovable causing some issues. If a task is still open, but we need to move to the next stage, we are unable to without completing the work order/form/task. Can these be turned back to movable fields? It was a much easier flow rather than the rigidness the new update is offering.\nJuly 15, 2025\nActivity Feed\nSort by\nNewest first\nToy Eastes\nMax Kazakov\nJust found another use case for this. Our conduit painter is having a baby and will be on paternaty leave soon so we have to assign his WOs early. Also, as the year end approaches, people want to pay early. Both of these sitautions include me manually opening a WO that is already in a later phase that is not yet opened, and then assiging the task and it will be done. But then later when the true phase is open, since I cannot archive, delete or move that WO knowing it is being done early, it will just open a duplicate and auto-assign to someone who has already done this, causing confusion. If they (or we) do not realize this WO still has to be closed, the project will potentially stall since that WO will remain open (as the task was already done it's possibly they'll ignore it thinking the alert was a glitch).\nIf we can move that WO to an earlier phase that is open, then there won't be a duplicate later.

Or even things like drawing revisions that were started but are not needed to be compelted before the applications, just before the install, and it's holding it up if not done.

Just like there is a drop down arrow next to each phase to show what's in it: If there could be a drop down arrow feature added to each work order, so you could click on an arrow on the side of the work order and see what is attached to it on the phase on the project.

Ryan currently has 25 assigned work orders, Jennifer has 20 and Tom has 5.\nThis work order would be round robin assigned to Tom to complete\nTaking it one step further, if I as an owner can define a capacity limit guideline per tech then that would be more optimal.\nSo in that same example; If Ryan's limit is 25, Jennifer's is 40 and Tom's is 5 then the work order would be assigned to Jennifer instead of Tom because she has open capacity.\nJuly 4, 2024\nActivity Feed\nSort by\nNewest first\nMax Kazakov\nmarked this post as\nunder\u00a0review\nFolks, we're considering doing in a way where you can assign a Team (group of users), not Role (used for access control).

For example, a project manager could be a collaborator on the install work order. So they can stay up to date on what happening in the feild and keep the customer in the loop. Another example, a design revision. We would like to add individuals as collaborators so they are aware to not schedule an inspection or request an approval until the design revision is complete. All of these are situatuions we were prefer to usethe collaborators function. But because you are only notified when you are added as a collaborator, not when anything on the work order progresses or when its complete, the collaborators function becomes somewhat useless.\nlike\nNovember 19, 2024\nReply\nPowered\u00a0by\u00a0Canny",

Please note that while there is no all in one photo album in the Project UI (that's a great idea), we do have the ability to export all photos as a ZIP. And their naming convention should be as you described. As far as HEICs go, test it out, and see if those get successfully converted to JPGs/PNGs.\nNovember 20, 2024\nReply\nKeaton Garner\nAdditionally, here is some functionality that would be incredible for all customers.\nBulk Export photos from a Form. These photos are renamed according to the title they were attached under in the form. So if I submit two photos under \"Battery Photos\", the output photos when exported would be called something like \"Battery_Photos(1), Battery_Photos(2), etc.\"\nIt would be important that they aren't labeled like this \"CUSTOMER_NAME_WORK_ORDER_NAME_FORM_NAME_Battery_Photos(1)\" because the primary reason people will be bulk exporting is to provide financing companies with photos. So if they're all named something similar, it's hard to sort through them without maybe doing them in list format in File Explorer.\nAdditionally, I personally work with two financing companies that don't accept image files formatted as .HEIF/.HEIC. This is unfortunate and I wish they'd change because that's the default format for iPhones, which means we have to manually reformat these photos. You should have your export tool reformat these to JPG or PNG so all financers can accept them.\nEven if the exporter had to zip things up, that would be much simpler than any current, practical solution. I currently have worked around this with a script that pulls the image from the S3 bucket and associates it with its title, but I still manage to find bugs and have to manually do some of the work anyway.\nThanks for the read!

(ex. when the \"electrical construction\" WO has been completed for Oahu, BI, Maui, etc. as each one needs a different WO since there is no conditional logic for WOs or forms based on workflows, or if we base it on phases, each WO has its own phase even if it's the same stage.)\nHOW: We can get around this by adding conditional logic to automations with a \"mark as today\" date for any specific action, such as \"when Electrical Construction WO is marked complete, fill Electrical Completed On field with today's date\" (meaning obviously that day's date). Or \"when Construction phase is marked complete, fill Construction Complete date field with today's date.\"\nSince we can resue the fields for all projects, we could then use this date field that would be auto filled at various times for every WO/workflow, we only need to have one column, not many, to indicate the same date across all projects/workflows.\nDecember 10, 2025\nPowered\u00a0by\u00a0Canny",

      "text": "7 \nFOREWORD by Rick Pedi and John Palmer\nORIGIN OF CUSTOMER JOBS THEORY Back in the days of the quality management movement (mid 1980s), the foundational tenet was that customers define quality. And so, deploying the Voice of the Customer (the VOC) throughout work processes became the central theme for improving business performance. This was especially true in product development, where design teams obsessed about gathering the VOC. In concept, properly researching the VOC would keep developers on track \u2013 not over-investing in features customers did not value, and thus, lose money, while not under-investing in features customers did value, and thus, lose customers. It was from this quality management perspective and the high business hopes of deploying the VOC that we created Customer Job Theory (JTBD) - together with Bob Moesta, Pam Murtaugh, and Julia Wesson. Because we are the original source of Customer Jobs, Alan Klement has reached out to us to share his JTBD thinking and to ask our point-of-view on the evolution of JTBD Theory in light of its actual foundational roots. With that in mind, he asked us to write this foreword for his book. \nBEYOND PRODUCT ATTRIBUTE QUALITY AS VALUE JTBD Theory represented a major shift in the focus of product developers and the kind of market research used to support product development. The thinking behind Customer Jobs was the hard-learned understanding that developers and marketers needed to adopt a new paradigm about the meaning of value-for-customers. Instead of attaching value to what products are, value should attach to what products do for customers. In other words, stop trying to communicate value with new and improved product features, and start designing more integrated product experiences that are valuable because of what they enable customers to get done in particular contexts of use. Our thinking called for new market research techniques that got beyond the prevailing methods that had customers evaluating products and describing lifestyle personas. Instead, we grounded customer interviews in recent real-life purchasing\n\nForeword \n 8 \nand use situations. We learned how customer behavior derives directly from how customers perceive their market-use situation. No one else can know their situations better than customers do. And we would disguise our research purposes to enable customers to tell us what they actually did and why they did it - openly, expressively, and with emotion. Our early Jobs research work never failed to generate amazing gaps between the reasons producers believed customers purchased products in the category (e.g., products were healthy, indulgent, or more convenient) and actual Job purposes customers had for \u201chiring a product\u201d. Business growth opportunities could be found in the degree to which the Job that heavy users were hiring the product category to do had not yet been discovered by light or non-users of the category. And optimizing the product design to do the Job better and then communicating the Job value became a good strategy for growing sales. \nAN EARLY EXAMPLE The early JTBD evangelists that we taught and inspired began using Snickers as the de facto standard-bearer for communicating the idea that customers hire products to do Jobs. Ever since 1930, consumers experienced the typical candy bar ingredients of chocolate and nougat combined with whole peanuts more as real food than a candy treat. And yet, it wasn\u2019t until 1979 - when Mars introduced the tag \u201cSnickers really satisfies\u201d \u2013 that Snickers reflected \u201cnew thinking\u201d. Much more than a quality cue, \u201cpacked with peanuts\u201d gave customers a reason to connect Snickers use with every day hunger situations. The Snickers example easily demonstrated several fundamentals of JTBD Theory that are now commonplace: There are often wide gaps between the value producers think customers assign to their products and the real reasons customers have for using the category. Marketing communications should focus on what a product does for (and to) the customer, not on what it is. A Snickers satisfies hunger \u2013 i.e., what it does. It is chocolate and nougat combined with whole peanuts.",

      "text": "Foreword \n 9 \nHow the design of products can be perfected against the customer\u2019s hiring criteria. The food-like qualities of peanuts, Snickers\u2019 first bite and chew characteristics, its shape, and its weight in the hand all combine to signal and deliver against the requirements of satisfying hunger in certain customer Job situations. The pitfalls and limitations of defining markets and competition in terms of product categories, versus, seeing markets from the customer\u2019s perspective. Mars came to understand that Snickers and Milky Way, which were thought of as \u201ccandy bars, chocolate confections, etc.\u201d were actually hired by customers for very different reasons. The slogan \u201cMilky Way, comfort in every bar\u201d recognized the differences between customers hiring Milky Way to do a \u201ccomfort me\u201d Job and the same customers hiring Snickers to do a \u201csatisfy my hunger\u201d Job. \nJTBD THEORY AND INNOVATION SUCCESS Over the last 15 years, we\u2019ve continued to advance the thinking we pioneered with JTBD Theory. Our focus has gone beyond using Jobs to explain customer choices. Instead, we have advanced core JTBD principles in order to understand how to develop new product concepts able to carve out new growth footholds in established, fiercely-competitive markets. We also have followed closely Clayton Christensen\u2019s popularization of JTBD Theory and the connections to innovation he and his followers have made. In paraphrasing Clay: A Job is the progress that an individual is trying to make in a particular circumstance. And for innovators, understanding the Job is to understand what customers care most about in that moment of trying to make progress \u2026 i.e., the causal mechanism of customer behavior. Therefore, JTBD Theory provides a way of understanding the foundational question of innovation success: what causes a customer to purchase and use a particular product or service. We respectfully disagree with the assertion that answering that question is the key to innovation success (of course that depends on your definition of innovation). How can you expect to invent new value propositions that will create tomorrow\u2019s\n\nForeword \n 10 \nmarkets \u2026 with an understanding of customer progress that only explains why customers buy products today? Moreover, understanding what customers care most about in that moment of trying to make progress, brings us back to the very beginning - JTBD Theory as way for businesses to grow sales by improving performance against the customer\u2019s definition of quality \u2013 essentially aligning today\u2019s products and services with the real reasons customers are buying them. Our work, on the other hand, has led to asking and answering a very different question as the foundational question of innovation success: how do individuals develop themselves by using the marketplace to advance towards the values, norms, and ideals that enrich the meaning of their lives. After all, innovation is relevant only if it creates or leads customers to substantial new meaning in how they lead their lives. And by focusing on creating new market behavior versus explaining current behavior, we shift the innovator\u2019s work from explaining historical choices based on what a product does and is \u2026 to understanding why and how customers would develop new market knowledge and behavior tomorrow. \nALAN\u2019S WORK AND WHAT\u2019S NEXT In light of our work, we find Alan\u2019s thinking to be a breath of fresh air. Through determination and perseverance, he has developed the forward-looking \u201cSelf-Betterment\u201d concept to explain the demand side of innovation. He makes a compelling case for Self-Betterment as a basis for innovators to work out what should be next. His case stands in stark contrast to prevailing JTBD Theory that can only explain today\u2019s customer choices. Alan\u2019s work recognizes that humans have a compelling imperative to improve themselves. His thinking echoes the work we have been doing to explain why people, whose needs are already well met, still hunt the market for new ideas. In our view, the Self-Betterment idea is on track and Alan is poised to develop it further in this direction: Human beings don\u2019t stand still. And in living their lives, they are restless innovators who use their environment - in this case the ecosystem of market information - to imagine better scenarios to their status quo \u2026 to change existing situations to preferred ones \u2026 to imagine what ought to be next in living their lives.\n\nForeword \n 11 \nStep-change business growth demands that new product concepts reflect the improvement imperative that keeps customers looking to the market for ideas, devices, and knowledge that break from the past. The \u201cnext book\u201d should fill in a picture of work we are now doing with causal models that explain how customers actually use the market to transform themselves and lift their capabilities for living the lives they imagine.",

Alan Klement October 2, 2016\n\n15 \n1 CHALLENGES, HOPE, AND PROGRESS Challenges Hope About me How to be successful with JTBD and this book Abandon every MBA, all you who enterThis book will help you become great at creating and selling products that people will buy. Your joy at work will grow. You will know how to help companies increase revenue, reduce waste, remain competitive, and make innovation more predictable and profitable. In doing so, you will help economies prosper and help provide stable jobs for employees and the families who depend on them. I struggled with innovation for many years. I finally made progress when I focused on two things: The desire every customer has to improve themselves and their life-situations. How customers imagine their lives being better when they have the right solution. This understanding has helped me become a better innovator. I believe it will do the same for you. Yet, challenges stand in your way. This chapter introduces these challenges. The rest of this book will equip you with the understanding of how your focus on the customer\u2019s desire for self-betterment as a Job to be Done (JTBD) will help you overcome these challenges. \nCHALLENGES Creative destruction is accelerating. The average time a company spends on the S&P 500 continues to drop. In 1960, it was fifty-five years; in 2015, it was about twenty (figure 1). This happened for numerous reasons. A big one is that it has never been easier to create a product and get it to customers. This increases the pace at which new innovations disrupt the sales of incumbent ones and then go on to replace them. This process is known as creative destruction.1\n\nChallenges, Hope, and Progress \n 16 \nWhen one innovation wins, another loses. Why? Because a day has only so many minutes, and a customer can use only one product at a time. For example, every day I used to get an espresso from a coffee shop down the street. Two months ago, I bought a Nespresso machine. Now I make my own espressos. The coffee shop has lost my business. The theory of Customer Jobs and the idea that customers buy a product to complete a Job to be Done, help us understand all the creative destruction around us. Even though solutions and technologies come and go, the customer\u2019s desire for self-betterment is always there. This focus on everyone\u2019s desire for self-betterment is the key to successful, ongoing innovation and business. \u201cSunk costs\u201d keep us from creating new products. In 1975, a Kodak engineer invented the digital camera. What was the management\u2019s response? They shelved it. Management argued that Kodak \u201ccould\u201d sell a digital camera, but why would they? They made billions of dollars selling photographic film. A digital camera would cannibalize their film sales. In the end, Kodak\u2019s management decided that the company would skip digital and focus on selling photographic film.2 In 2012, Kodak filed for bankruptcy. What happened? Customers no longer needed film for their cameras\u2014they had switched to digital cameras. Kodak\u2019s downfall was due to management\u2019s unwillingness to adapt to a world with digital cameras\u2014something they had invented forty years earlier. \nFigure 1. Creative destruction in action. The average company life span on the S&P 500 index has declined over time (rolling seven-year average).",

      "text": "Challenges, Hope, and Progress \n 17 \nVery often, it\u2019s not legacy technology that stops companies from adapting, but being tied to a legacy business model. And when change is proposed to management, they have unlimited excuses to avoid it: \u201cWe make billions of dollars with our current products. Why risk it by selling something different?\u201d; \u201cWe\u2019ve spent a hundred years perfecting what we do and building the company we have today. Why should we change?\u201d Excuses like these make it hard for businesses to adapt, but change will always happen. Customer Jobs gives you the confidence to break away from legacy business models and create the products of tomorrow.3 It\u2019s a mistake to focus on our customers\u2019 physical characteristics. My father-in-law is sixty-five years old, is from the Bronx, and has never used a computer in his life. I\u2019m thirty-five years old, from Florida, and wrote my first computer program at fifteen. Our behaviors, physical characteristics, life goals, and personal histories couldn\u2019t be more different. Nevertheless, we both own the same model of smartphone. We even use it in almost the same way. Will a study of who we are and how we behave explain why? Which data in figure 2 are information? Which are misinformation?4 JTBD helps you become better at knowing the difference between good data and bad data. This helps you focus on making changes to your product that bring profits instead of increasing your costs of production only. \nFigure 2. What data about your product are information? Which are misinformation?\n\nChallenges, Hope, and Progress \n 18 \nWe don\u2019t take into consideration how customers see competition. In 2006, Indian manufacturer Godrej collaborated with Harvard Business School professor Dr. Clayton Christensen to create the chotuKool\u2014a low-cost, feature-minimal refrigerator. It was hailed as a \u201cdisruptive innovation\u201d that would create a new market of refrigerators and create what Christensen calls \u201cinclusive growth\u201d for millions of low-income Indians. Unfortunately, the chotuKool was a costly flop. What happened? For far too long, academics and analysts\u2014who have no personal experience with innovation\u2014have created and sold pseudoscientific theories of innovation. Unfortunately, these theories often mislead. The resulting product failures exact terrible costs on our economies. This happens because most, and perhaps all, of these theories don\u2019t take into consideration how customers view competition. Do PCs compete with mainframes because they\u2019re both \u201ccomputers,\u201d or do PCs compete with typewriters, video game systems, and accountants? Do hard drives compete only with other hard drives, or do they also compete with tape storage, CDs, DVDs, floppy disks, flash drives, and cloud storage? JTBD helps you avoid mistakes like the chotuKool and falling victim to invalid theories of markets by giving you the knowledge to create an accurate model of competition before you create a product. It does this by helping you learn how to gain the customer\u2019s perspective on what does and doesn\u2019t count as competition for a JTBD. We myopically study and improve on customers\u2019 \u201cneeds\u201d and expectations of today; instead, we should create new systems that help customers make progress. In the 1860s, the Pony Express was created to help customers get letters and messages across the United States as fast as possible. It lasted only nineteen months. What happened? Western Union established the transcontinental telegraph. While the Pony Express was trying to solve the \u201cneeds\u201d associated with using physical mail, Western Union thought, what if we could communicate without using physical messages? 5 Very often, innovators think they are studying customers\u2019 needs \u2013 when in fact they are studying what customers don\u2019t like about the products they use today, or what customers currently expect from a product. For many years, manufacturers such as Nokia, Palm, Research in Motion (RIM), and Motorola worked hard to satisfy customers\u2019 stated needs and expectations: make a low-price smartphone with a physical keyboard. Today, those expectations have been reversed. Customers don\u2019t mind shelling out several hundred dollars for a smartphone, and physical keyboards have almost completely disappeared.",

      "text": "Challenges, Hope, and Progress \n 19 \nWe can\u2019t build the products of tomorrow when we limit ourselves to the needs and expectations associated with the products of today. Instead, we should focus on what never changes for customers: their desire for progress. When we focus on delivering customers\u2019 progress\u2014instead of what customers say they want\u2014we are free to imagine a world where many needs and expectations are replaced with new ones. Customer Jobs theory helps us ask, \u201cCustomers keep asking for a smartphone with a keyboard, but couldn\u2019t we help customers so much more if we take it away?\u201d Chapters 13 and 14 show you the power of prioritizing customer progress over everything else. We may think about the upsides of product changes only, ignore the downsides, and fail to embrace new ways of helping customers make progress. In the early 1980s, the Coca-Cola Company was losing market share to Pepsi. In response, Coca-Cola\u2019s management decided to change the formula for Coke, believing that the change would increase market share. They were wrong. Loyal customers went up in arms over it; three months later, Coca-Cola\u2019s original formula was restored. Over time, the company regained its market share, but it was lucky. It had the money and resources to recover from the mistake.6 Customer Jobs helps you know when it does and doesn\u2019t make sense to change your product. Your product might be fine the way it is. Any further investment might increase only your costs of production. Customer Jobs also helps you understand the opportunity costs: what happens when you don\u2019t invest in new products, even if it means cannibalizing existing offerings? Kodak knows the cost of not embracing new ways of helping customers evolve: bankruptcy. Our decision making can be misled when we manage by visible figures only. Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT) and Net Promoter Score (NPS) are figures that seems straightforward enough. Ask customers to self-report their satisfaction with your product and record their responses. If CSAT or NPS are high, you\u2019re doing a good job. Easy, right? Yet, such data and figures are incomplete at best and misinformation at worst. In chapter 13, you\u2019ll learn about Spirit Airlines. Customers have consistently rated it as the worst airline in the United States. Nevertheless, it continues to be the fastest-growing and most profitable airline in America. If customers hate it so much, why do they keep flying it?\n\nChallenges, Hope, and Progress \n 20 \nFigures can not only be misleading, they can also be misused. We see this today with the number of monthly active users (MAU) for Twitter. It has experienced explosive growth over the last five years\u2014annual revenue was $106 million in 2011 and $2.2 billion in 2015. Yet analysts and journalists continue to write articles titled \u201cThe End of Twitter\u201d and \u201cA Eulogy for Twitter.\u201d Why? The most common criticism is that growth of Twitter\u2019s MAUs has stalled at \u201conly\u201d 313 million. Is it any surprise when management\u2019s priority then becomes \u201cHow can we make MAUs go up?\u201d instead of \u201cHow can we continue to make Twitter valuable to users, so they won\u2019t leave?\u201d Yes, adding new features might push up visible figures such as MAU in the short term, but constant changes might upset and drive away loyal users. Instead, we should congratulate Twitter\u2019s employees for their hard work and gently remind them of grandmother\u2019s advice: \u201cWhen you try and please everyone, you end up pleasing no one.\u201d7 Many innovators and managers have been influenced by ideas such as: If you can\u2019t measure it, you can\u2019t manage it. What gets measured gets improved. However, such opinions do not take into consideration the following:8 \nFigure 3. A tale of creative destruction. Chasing visible figures often leads to poor decisions about your product.",

      "text": "Challenges, Hope, and Progress \n 21 \nAll models are wrong, but some are useful. The most important figures are unknown or unknowable, but successful management must nevertheless take account of them. If you torture the data long enough, they will tell you whatever you want. It is wrong to suppose that if you can\u2019t measure it, you can\u2019t manage it \u2013 a costly myth. These statements were made by some of the most important mathematicians and systems thinkers of the twentieth century. They are warnings for those who subscribe to the idea of being driven by visible figures only, and not taking into consideration figures that are unknown or unknowable. Yes, visible figures can be helpful and are often necessary. We have payroll to meet and should strive to increase long-term profits. But we can let figure based data deceive us. We must remember that data are only proxies for some results of a system. Moreover, the most important figures are unknown and unknowable. What figures or data would have told Apple to remove floppy drives from PCs or keyboards from their smartphones? At the time, many dismissed or criticized these ideas. Journalists claimed Apple\u2019s management had lost their minds. Now we regard Apple\u2019s decisions as obvious. And what about Twitter\u2019s MAUs? The number of users who might want a product like Twitter is a figure that is unknown and unknowable. Twitter\u2019s 313 million MAU might represent 100 percent of the market. Analysts, journalists, and even Twitter\u2019s own shareholders might be punishing the company even as it achieves market dominance. There are a variety of consequences that arise when we abandon intuition and risk taking in favor of management by visible figures only. Perhaps the worst are the unfounded beliefs that a product will last forever, and that products and companies can continuously grow revenue and attract more customers. The reality is that growth for every product will slow and stop. Nothing lasts forever. Unfortunately, many managers either don\u2019t know or won\u2019t accept this. Instead, they become worried when growth slows. They start making changes to their product in hopes of attracting more customers and increasing revenue; however, the effect is often the opposite. Management ends up making the product worse for existing customers. With some luck, a competitor won\u2019t notice.9\n\nChallenges, Hope, and Progress \n 22 \nBut luck will eventually run out. Another innovation will enter the market with a product that customers find more valuable (figure 3). Why? Because the entrant\u2019s innovation cuts off all the baggage the incumbent added during management\u2019s frantic attempt to push up all those visible figures. This is when customers begin to switch from the incumbent to the newcomer. So, goes the cycle of creative destruction. Innovation is hard, risky, and nerve-racking. Just ask anyone who has successfully done it. But Customer Jobs can help. With the correct point of view, we can see how visible figures tell us about individual parts of a system only. Once we understand that, we can apply Customer Jobs thinking and understand the relationships around the data. This gives us the ability to assign the proper weight to these figures\u2014or even dismiss them. This helps us become better at knowing if we should continue to improve an existing product or take a risk and develop a new one. \nHOPE Customer Jobs theory and this book offer you hope whether you are a struggling innovator or just want to become better at understanding, marketing, innovation, product design, or all three. Customer Jobs gives you a collection of principles for understanding why customers buy and use products. This singular attention to customer\u2019s desire for self-betterment\u2014instead of what customers say they want, their demographics, or what they do\u2014is what distinguishes Customer Jobs from other theories. This book aims to explain the theory reliably and consistently. At the time of this writing (2015), no comprehensive book about Customer Jobs theory exists. This is the first. Many others have written interpretations of some of its principles, but almost all of them have created more confusion than clarity. This book stands out from other writings about Customer Jobs because its contributors\u2014including me\u2014are all innovators and entrepreneurs in our own right. We\u2019ve applied the theory to our own businesses and products, rather than merely study and preach it. I developed this book and Customer Jobs theory as if I were creating a product. For Customer Jobs to be successful, it must deliver progress to those who plan on using it. This is why I interviewed sixty-three innovators about their struggles with innovation and how Job to be Done helped them design a better product. I",

I had to combine my experiences with those of these innovators to design Customer Jobs into what it should be. I learned something from every practitioner I talked with. I am in their debt. Of course, you benefit the most. With this book, you add the accumulated experience of many successful innovators to your own. This collective knowledge will help you become better at creating and selling products that customers will buy. \nTHE PROGRESS YOU CAN MAKE WITH CUSTOMER JOBS Customer Jobs is attractive to many because it offers you progress in many ways. Here are a few of my favorite. Alignment and distributed decision-making. Insights around a customer\u2019s Jobs to be Done serves as a \"true north\". Everyone in the business will use the same customer insights to market, design, build, and manage solutions that customers will buy and use to make progress in their lives. This empowers employees throughout the organization to make good decisions that align with the job, be autonomous and innovative. Know what data are and are not needed for innovation. Innovators created Customer Jobs theory for themselves. We didn\u2019t create it to sell books, collect speaking fees, sell MBA diplomas, or get a PhD from a business school. We created Customer Jobs because we needed help creating successful products that could support our families. In order to do this, we had to figure out what data were and were not relevant to our innovation efforts. When we design, we\u2019re faced the countless trade-offs involved in developing a business strategy, crafting advertising, designing, and engineering, from which questions like these arise: We can\u2019t attack every market. Which ones should we focus on? Our video ad must connect with customers in just five seconds. How can we do that? Which shade of white will help customers experience luxurious but not sterile?\n\nChallenges, Hope, and Progress \n 24 \nWhich alloy should the suspension be made of to give customers the \u201cfeel the road\u201d experience? Once you know that you need answers to questions like these, you know which data are and are not important. Not only that, you know what should and should not be measured \u2013 as well as what can and cannot be measured. Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted. \u2014William Bruce Cameron JTBD helps create and sustain a growth culture: What happens when you don\u2019t have a healthy growth mindset? You end up wasting time and money building products and features that don\u2019t increase revenue. I learned that lesson the hard way \u2013 both when I was a Product Manager and as an entrepreneur. JTBD immunes us with the idea that organizations grow when they offer a growth opportunity to existing and potential customers. No one wants to solve their problems only, we want someone to also give us new and better ways to improve our life-situations in meaningful ways. This thinking helps us answer important growth-related questions such as: How can we make sure people continue to buy our existing product? How can we get more people to buy our product, or get them to buy more of it? What additional products and services can we create that existing customers will also buy? What additional products and services can we create that can gain us new customers. Customer Jobs and its focus on progress gives us a way to think about and answer these questions. Customer Jobs is a theory evolved over time. The principles of Customer Jobs draw on studies in statistical theory, economics, systems thinking, and psychology. Its principles have slowly evolved over time\u2014at least seventy-five years. It is by no means a flavor of the month.",

      "text": "Challenges, Hope, and Progress \n 25 \nAs a theory, Customer Jobs persists because it is completely decoupled from describing what kind of product you should make. Instead, it is purely focused on understanding how all customers desire to evolve themselves. You need such a theory to help you become better at innovation. \nHOW TO BE SUCCESSFUL WITH CUSTOMER JOBS AND THIS BOOK As to methods there may be a million and then some, but principles are few. The man who grasps principles can successfully select his own methods. The man who tries methods, ignoring principles, is sure to have trouble. \u2014Harrington Emerson I don\u2019t believe there is any one \u201cright\u201d way to innovate. Life has too many unknown and unknowable variables. Successful entrepreneur Steve Blank illustrates this by saying, \u201cNo business plan survives first contact with a customer.\u201d10 Customer Jobs prepares us for whatever curveballs are thrown at us because it equips us with principles instead of methods. Why? Methods come and go, whereas principles stick around. In fact, when you\u2019re armed with the right principles, you can plug in any appropriate methods and mental models. You might even create your own methods. And while this idea may cause you some anxiety, over time you will find it empowering. The study and application of principles, instead of methods, is what gives you the confidence to act in a complex world. While it\u2019s easier to teach and learn methods, you become a better designer and innovator when you ground yourself with principles. This is why this book focuses on principles and demonstrates those principles in action through case studies. Most chapters also have a \u201cPut it to work\u201d section that gives ideas on how to apply these principles. \nABOUT ME I recommend Customer Jobs because I\u2019ve applied its principles as an entrepreneur, product manager, designer, engineer, and salesperson. I\u2019ve applied it to my own businesses and on products whose success I was directly responsible for. I believe it\u2019s wrong to preach a theory unless you\u2019ve applied it yourself and were exposed to the risks in the event the theory failed.\n\nChallenges, Hope, and Progress \n 26 \nCustomer Jobs has helped me. I struggled with innovation for many years. I started my first business in 2003. It offered photographic services, image retouching, and a software platform where customers could create their own websites to showcase their artwork. It was a success. At the time, I didn\u2019t understand why it was successful. But now I do. It was because I offered a collection of products that worked together\u2014as a system\u2014to help customers make progress. What progress did those customers want? \u201cHelp me get recognition for myself and my work.\u201d As my business grew, I saw myself transition from maker to manager. I didn\u2019t like it. So, I sold the business and went back to making things. I started another business called Vizipres. It failed. Why? I made a product that people would use, but not pay for. I thought that perhaps I needed to learn from other entrepreneurs. I began working for others as an engineer and designer. Later, I began leading innovation efforts at various companies. Inspired by all this knowledge, I began a third business called AIM. After a few iterations, it ended up as an advertising marketplace for mortgage brokers and real estate agents. As soon as it gained momentum, I sold it to my cofounder. I learned long ago that I\u2019m a maker, not a manager. That\u2019s also when I realized that Customer Jobs, at the time, was incomplete. Many of the principles and suggested theory of the time were inconsistent and often contradictory. I decided to unpack, refine, and expand its principles to help others and myself. And as of today \u2013 as I update the 2nd edition of this book \u2013 I\u2019m in the process of applying JTBD theory to create another product. Keep an eye out. \nABANDON EVERY MBA, ALL YOU WHO ENTER I invite you to explore JTBD with me. I also ask that you\u2014at least for the time being\u2014put aside any preconceived notions of competition, markets, and even Customer Jobs. You can pick them up again when the book is finished, or you may decide you no longer need them.\n\n27 \n PART I The Job to be Done Our journey begins with an introduction to Customer Jobs theory and the idea of a customer having a Job to be Done (JTBD).

A Job to be Done defined Products enable customers to get a Job Done Where does Customer Jobs theory come from? Upgrade your user, not your product. Don\u2019t build better cameras\u2014build better photographers. \u2014Kathy Sierra Ten thousand years ago, we were hunter gatherers and used our feet to roam the earth. Today, we have fast food restaurants and autonomous cars. Why did we change? Because we have an intrinsic desire to transform our life-situations into something better. We do this by remaking and adapting to the world around us. The desire to improve ourselves and our life-situations is in our DNA. It\u2019s what makes us human. Moreover, we do these transformations with purpose. We purposefully use the arts to improve ourselves emotionally; the sciences to improve ourselves intellectually; and engineering to improve how we interact with the world. Purposeful transformation is why we are different from animals: A bear trying to catch food by the river may think: I wish fishing could be made better, faster, or easier. But only a human will think: Fishing is no good. If I could transform that lagoon over there into a place where I can breed fish, then I\u2019d never have to go fishing again. The bear thinks only about what is. Today, it may come up with a better, faster, or easier way to fish. But tomorrow, it is still a bear that fishes. The human, on the other hand, thinks about what ought to be. Today, she fishes, but tomorrow that can change. If she could figure out a way to no longer do the fishing herself, then she can focus on improving other life-situations\u2014like building a hut so she could move out of that dank cave.\n\nWhat Is Customer Jobs? What Is A Job to Be Done (JTBD)? \n 30 \nThe bear does not think about transforming itself or its world. It never has a Job to be Done. The human, on the other hand, can desire change. And every time she begins the process of transforming her life-situation, she has a Job to be Done. \nIMPROVE YOUR LIFE-SITUATION; BECOME MORE THAN YOU ARE Why are you reading this book? I guarantee you\u2019re not reading it for the sake of reading it only. Do you have any social or functional goals you aim to achieve? I doubt it. I\u2019m not sure how a book can be described in terms of \u201cfunctional\u201d unless you use it as a door-stop. And social? Well, unless your plan is to tell everyone you\u2019ve \u201cread the most amazing book!\u201d (a course of action I highly recommend), I don\u2019t see how there\u2019s any social element to it either. Besides, isn\u2019t every social action really a personal, emotional desire to gain recognition? I don\u2019t think there are any social or functional purposes for reading this book. Rather, I believe you are reading this book because you hope to become better at creating and selling products that people will buy and use. And this Job to be Done of yours \u2013 make you better at making and selling products that people will buy \u2013 is why you are hiring this book. In fact, I bet you don\u2019t even want to read this book. You do so because it is the only way for you to gain the knowledge contained herein. If it were possible to download the knowledge into your brain \u2013 like the character Neo from the Matrix \u2013 you would probably choose that instead. Job theory starts with the premise that we, as humans, always want to improve our various life-situations in a variety of ways. This exploration of our core desire to improve ourselves has a long philosophical tradition. The ancient Greek poet Pindar wrote about \u201cbecoming who you are\u201d. That is, the exploration and realization of the self is ongoing. This tradition has continued through to recent times. The work of philosopher-psychologist Friedrich Nietzsche\u2019s advocates the humans-seek-self-betterment in various ways. Even Sigmund Freud picked up on this, offering the idea that we attach things to ourselves to become \u201cprosthetic Gods.\u201d11 It can be shown that every living thing does everything it can not to preserve itself, but to become more. \u2014The Will to Power, Friedrich Nietzsche",

      "text": "What Is Customer Jobs? What Is A Job to Be Done (JTBD)? \n 31 \nNow, I doubt you picked up this book to learn philosophy. My aim is to illustrate the idea that our desire for self-betterment is a core human desire. We should take advantage of this truth and use it in our efforts to create sustainable growth for our businesses. And interestingly, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the first one to have this idea. Charles Revson, founder of Revlon, perfectly encapsulates a JTBD when he said:12 In the factory, we make cosmetics. In the drugstore, we sell hope. With these words, Revson marks the difference between what customers buy, and why they buy it. This thinking was also carried over into Revlon\u2019s advertising. In 1952, Revlon\u2019s breakout advertising campaign was Fire and Ice (figure 4). The advertising campaign makes it clear: Revlon isn\u2019t selling a product, it\u2019s selling transformation \u2013 the idea that, with this product in your life, you\u2019ll be able to create a \u201cnew me\u201d that is desirable in ways your \u201cexisting me\u201d is not. This idea of selling transformation is why there\u2019s barely any mention of any product in the ad. One whole page is a check list of provocative questions; the other features a picture of model Dorian Leigh. Only on further investigation do you notice the lipstick and nail polish at the bottom of the page. \nFigure 4. What is Revlon really selling?\n\nWhat Is Customer Jobs? What Is A Job to Be Done (JTBD)? \n 32 \nA Job to be Done is neither found nor spontaneously created. Rather, it is designed. The checklist of provocative questions such as, \u201cHave you ever wanted to wear an ankle bracelet?\u201d exists to help customers imagine (i.e., design) what the new me will look and be like when they buy Revlon\u2019s products. Then there\u2019s the picture of Dorian Leigh. Upon seeing that, consumers continue to design a new version of themselves in their mind. For some, the new me looks like her. For others, the new me is with her. Whatever the case, if this new me who experiences new life-situations is something I want, I begin desiring it. In other words, I have a Job to be Done. \nA JOB TO BE DONE DEFINED Customer Jobs theory states that markets grow and transform whenever customers have a Job to be Done, and then buy a product to complete it (get the Job Done). This makes a Job to be Done a transformation process: it starts, it runs, and it ends. The key difference, however, is that a JTBD describes how a customer changes or wishes to change. We define a JTBD as follows: A Job to be Done is the process a consumer goes through whenever she aims to transform her existing life-situation into a preferred one, but cannot because there are constraints that stop her. \nPRODUCTS ENABLE CUSTOMERS TO GET A JOB DONE Humans are limited in our abilities. We can\u2019t change a life-situation by ourselves. A snap of our fingers cannot create a world where a morning commute is an enjoyable experience. Realizing such a change requires innovation on the part of oneself or someone else. Progress can only happen when we attach and integrate new ideas and new products into our lives. An example of constructing (i.e., designing) a Job to be Done comes from a research project I led to understand what Job or Jobs customers were hoping to get Done (i.e., what new me customers were hoping to create) with a project management",

Notice how the hero of our story comes to realize a new me is possible, and how he must attach a product to himself to attain that new me: Andreas began a business around medical tourism. Over time, he grew his business to include five employees. One day, he was out with a friend of his, Jamie, at a coffee shop. During their conversation, Jamie mentioned a product called Basecamp to Andreas. Andreas had never heard of it. He was curious to learn more. Jamie explained to Andreas that Basecamp was a project management tool that helped small businesses become better at organizing themselves. Andreas was surprised by this. He knew about complicated project management products like Microsoft Project, but those were for big companies only, not smaller ones like his. Currently, Andreas was using Google Sheets, Google Docs, and e-mail to run his company. He just assumed that, well, that\u2019s how companies his size operated. Jamie further explained that Basecamp was made specifically to help companies his size. As Jamie spoke, Andreas\u2019s mind began racing: Basecamp could help my company stay organized as it adds more customers and employees. Up until this point, he had just assumed that his company had hit its growth limit. \nFigure 5. The designers at intercom (intercom.com) use this illustration to show the difference between what customers buy, and what they want.\n\nWhat Is Customer Jobs? What Is A Job to Be Done (JTBD)? \n 34 \nAndreas and Jamie enjoyed their coffee and parted ways. During his train ride home, Andreas looked up Basecamp on his mobile device. He also learned about and investigated similar products to Basecamp. In the end, he decided to go with Basecamp. He signed up or it, began using it, and grew his company beyond five employees for the first time. This is what a Job to be Done looks like. A consumer goes along his life as he\u2019s come to know it. Then things change. He is presented with an opportunity to improve his life-situation\u2014in this case, make changes so he can grow. When or if he finds a product that helps him realize that growth opportunity, he can evolve to that better version of himself he had imagined. In the case of Andreas, Basecamp enabled him to gain control over how his business could be run. This enabled him to grow it beyond a few employees for the first time. Besides demonstrating a JTBD well, Andreas\u2019s story also demonstrates that creating a new me (i.e., having a JTBD) is a process. It\u2019s not something that consumers have; it\u2019s something consumers participate in. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called a Job to be Done. A comparable example is falling in love. Falling in love isn\u2019t something you have; it\u2019s something you participate in. And just as you can\u2019t complete the fall-in-love process by yourself, a customer can\u2019t complete a JTBD by himself. He needs a product to help him design, construct, and complete it. \nFigure 6. Samuel Hulick uses this illustration to show how customers use products to design a \"new me\".",

      "text": "What Is Customer Jobs? What Is A Job to Be Done (JTBD)? \n 35 \nCustomers are always beautifully, wonderfully dissatisfied, even when they report being happy and business is great. Even when they don\u2019t yet know it, customers want something better, and your desire to delight customers will drive you to invent on their behalf. No customer ever asked Amazon to create the Prime membership program, but it sure turns out they wanted it, and I could give you many such examples. \u2014Jeff Bezos13 \nWHAT ISN\u2019T A JOB TO BE DONE While many of us have been applying Customer Jobs for a while\u2014Rick Pedi and John Palmer have been developing Customer Jobs since the 1990s\u2014it has gained popularity only recently. And like so many things that spread quickly, many people have distorted and misinterpreted it. The biggest mistake I see is thinking of a Job to be Done as an activity or task. Examples include store and retrieve music, listen to music, cut a straight line, or make a quarter-inch hole. These are not Jobs; rather, they are tasks and activities \u2013 which means they describe how you use a product or what you do with it. For example, music streaming products such as Pandora and Spotify were designed specifically so customers didn\u2019t have to store and retrieve music like when they used CDs or MP3s. As far as listen to music, that is a broad activity that varies wildly depending on the context. Someone listening to music, so he can maintain his motivation during a workout is engaging in a very different activity than someone going to the opera to listen to music. The problem with describing customer demand as activities is well articulate by the creator of Activity-Centered Design, Don Norman:14 Harvard professor Theodore Levitt once pointed out, \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole!\u201d Levitt\u2019s example of the drill implying that the goal is really a hole is only partially correct, however. When people go to a store to buy a drill, that is not their real goal. But why would anyone want a quarter-\n\nWhat Is Customer Jobs? What Is A Job to Be Done (JTBD)? \n 36 \ninch hole? Clearly that is an intermediate goal. Perhaps they wanted to hang shelves on the wall. Levitt stopped too soon. Once you realize that they don\u2019t really want the drill, you realize that perhaps they don\u2019t really want the hole, either: they want to install their bookshelves. Why not develop methods that don\u2019t require holes? Or perhaps books that don\u2019t require bookshelves. (Yes, I know: electronic books, e-books.) Besides, there are already brilliant design methods out there to help you design for tasks and activities. Examples include Activity Theory, Don Norman\u2019s Activity-Centered Design (figure 7), Cognitive Task Analysis, Goal Directed Design, Use Cases, and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). If you want to learn more about how to design for activities or tasks, go there. There are not different types of Jobs. Another common mistake is to think that there are types of Jobs. In particular, some may think there are emotional, function, and social Jobs. I\u2019ll describe why it\u2019s a bad idea from both a practical and theoretical perspective. Practically, you\u2019ll be more successful when you think of every Customer Job as unique. We\u2019ve learned that while many Jobs share the same core emotional desires (e.g., belonging, self-expression, control, etc.), each Job is a unique combination of these desires. That is why each product should deliver on these core emotional desires in its own way. A good example is Facebook. A lot of people use Facebook because it taps into desires such as control, self-expression, and belonging\u2014but it \nFigure 7. Don Norman\u2019s 1988 book, the design of everyday things, features activity-centered design and the seven stages of action seen here. This theory formed the basis of ideologies such as task analysis and human-computer interaction.\n\nWhat Is Customer Jobs? What Is A Job to Be Done (JTBD)? \n 37 \ndoes so in its own unique way. So instead of saying that there are types of Jobs, you\u2019ll be much better off thinking that each Job is unique. Theoretically\u2014that is, from an ontological and epistemological perspective\u2014Customer Jobs are design (artificial) problems, not natural problems. Natural problems are falsifiable. This means they can be objectively measured and determined as either true or false: Q: Is argon (Ar) a noble gas? A: If under conditions X it reacts, then yes; otherwise, no. Design problems, on the other hand, are not falsifiable and cannot be measured objectively: Q: How do we reduce crime? Person 1: \u201cImprove education.\u201d Person 2: \u201cHire more police officers.\u201d \nFigure 8. Are you describing a job to be done, or something else?",

      "text": "What Is Customer Jobs? What Is A Job to Be Done (JTBD)? \n 38 \nWith respect to Jobs, then, no objective test can be created to say, \u201cThis is a social Job. That is not a social Job.\u201d If I buy a Ferrari to impress other people, is it a \u201csocial\u201d Job because I want to impress other people? Or should we rephrase it as an insecurity, making it a \u201cpersonal\u201d or \u201cemotional\u201d Job? And because there\u2019s no way to objectively define each type of Job, every person on the team will have his or her own opinion of what type of Job it should be. Moreover, even if/when you do get consensus, so what? Isn\u2019t knowing that I bought a Ferrari because I want to \u201cfit in\u201d good enough? What do you gain by labeling it a social or personal Job? I\u2019ll tell you: absolutely nothing. Take it from me, don\u2019t waste your time trying to dissect Jobs into different types. It\u2019s about as productive as trying to answer, \u201cHow many angels can dance on the head of a pin?\u201d Is it a Customer Job? Does it describe an improved life-situation or something else? When presented with a possible description of a Customer Job, the best framework of thinking I can offer you is the decision tree in figure 8. Keep in mind that a Job to be Done describes the \u201cbetter me.\u201d It answers the question, \u201cHow are you better since you started using [product]?\u201dand \u201cNow that you have this product, what can you do now that you couldn\u2019t do before?\u201d Renowned psychologist Albert Bandura described humans as \u201cproactive, aspiring organisms\u201d. Customer Jobs carries this idea into markets, making the claim that we buy and use things to improve ourselves, to make progress. If you\u2019re not describing a Customer Job in terms of progress, you\u2019re probably describing something else. \nWHERE DOES CUSTOMER JOBS THEORY COME FROM? The greatest\u2014and most helpful\u2014theories are not created by one person but are the result of many people over a long period (figure 9). This is certainly the case with JTBD. Its principles have emerged from the work of a long lineage of researchers and innovators. Here are the most notable. Joseph Schumpeter and creative destruction. The roots of JTBD thinking go back at least seventy-five years to Joseph Schumpeter and his introduction of creative destruction. Schumpeter observed that new innovations steal customers\n\nWhat Is Customer Jobs? What Is A Job to Be Done (JTBD)? \n 39 \nfrom incumbent offerings and then eventually go on to replace them. At one time, horses and ships were our primary methods of personal transportation. Eventually, trains replaced horses, but then cars and airplanes replaced those trains and ships. Customer Jobs incorporates Schumpeter\u2019s insights as it seeks to understand why customers pick one way of doing things over another. Yes, innovators create new solutions, but the wheels of creative destruction turn only through the interaction between customers and innovators. Customer Jobs also incorporates another one of Schumpeter\u2019s brilliant insights that is almost always overlooked. Schumpeter argued that competition should not be measured only among products of the same \u201ctype.\u201d He insisted that competition can come from anywhere. You might think you\u2019re alone in a market or have market superiority, but some competitor unknown to you could be stealing away your customers. Your only sign that something is wrong is decreasing sales. In chapter 8, we take a close look at Customer Jobs, creative destruction, and competition W. Edwards Deming and systems thinking. Schumpeter\u2019s influence on Customer Jobs is restricted mostly to factors of market dynamics and competition; however, W. Edwards Deming has influenced Customer Jobs the most.

Deming\u2019s most notable influence comes from his development of systems thinking, which I discuss in chapter 13. Throughout Deming\u2019s career, he frequently reminded businesses that producers and customers are connected by systems: The customer and producer must work together as a system. The consumer is the most important part of the production line. Deming often challenged companies to remember creative destruction. He impressed on business leadership that simply making a product better and better\u2014improving what already exists\u2014wasn\u2019t enough. Sooner or later, someone will invent something new. He would tell businesses the following: Makers of vacuum tubes improved year by year the power of vacuum tubes. Customers were happy. But then transistor radios came along. Happy customers of vacuum tubes deserted vacuum tubes and ran for the pocket radio. A dissatisfied customer does not complain; he just switches. Deming understood that improving products of today continually isn\u2019t enough: \u201cWe must keep asking, what new product or service would help our customers more? What will we be making five years from now? Ten years from now?\u201d For Deming, the process of innovation should never stop.15 Psychology. On the psychology front, you\u2019ll run into influences from Gary Klein, Amos Tversky, Daniel Kahneman, George Loewenstein, and Ann Graybiel. These are psychologists and scientists whose work forms the foundations of behavioral economics and naturalistic decision making (NDM). Their work helps us understand how and why customers don\u2019t make rational decisions when buying and using products, are inconsistent in their opinions of products, and don\u2019t always act in their best interest. Customer Jobs understands that if you want to make a great product and to develop a message that connects with customers, you have to understand the emotional forces that shape their motivation. Bringing it all together. Then, you arrive at John B. Palmer, Rick Pedi, Bob Moesta, Julia Wesson, and Pam Murtaugh. In the 1990s, they began working together to combine their respective experiences into the first Customer Jobs\n\nWhat Is Customer Jobs? What Is A Job to Be Done (JTBD)? \n 41 \nprinciples. They are the ones who came up with the idea and language that customers have \u201cJobs\u201d that they are trying to get \u201cDone.\u201d Then, you get to me and this book. John, Rick, and Bob have personally influenced me more than I could ever express. Last but certainly not least, the entire JTBD community has had a tremendous influence on me. Without their application of and experience with JTBD, this book would not have been possible.",

      "text": "43 \n3 WHAT ARE THE PRINCIPLES OF CUSTOMER JOBS? Here are a few JTBD principles that you will see demonstrated repeatedly throughout this book. There are others, but the principles below are perhaps the most useful and commonly used in the Customer Jobs community.\nPRINCIPLES OF CUSTOMER JOBS Customers don\u2019t want your product or what it does; they want help making themselves better (i.e., they want to transform a life-situation, make progress). Charles Revson knew that customers didn\u2019t want cosmetics, which are just colored oils. He also knew that customers didn\u2019t want what those cosmetics do, which is simply coloring skin. He understood that his customers wanted hope. This understanding of customer motivation has helped keep Revlon in business for eighty-four years. In 2015, its revenue topped $1.9 billion. It seems that selling hope is a profitable business.16 Focusing on the product itself, what it does, or how customers use it closes your mind to innovation opportunities. For example, if you sold drills, you might be tempted to think that people buy drills and bits because they want holes. But then 3M comes along and develops an entire line of damage-free hanging products that are designed specifically to eliminate the need for a drill or for making any holes. Another manufacturer, Erard, also avoided the \u201ccustomers want holes\u201d trap. It promotes a collection of TV mounts with a simple description: \u201cThe first TV wall-mount bracket with no drilling of the wall required.\u201d While you were convinced customers wanted holes, your competitors understood that customers wanted help improving their lives.17 People have Jobs; things don\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t make sense to ask, \u201cWhat Job is your product doing?\u201d or say, \u201cThe Job of the phone is\u2026\u201d or \u201cThe Job of the watch is\u2026\u201d Phones, watches, and dry-cleaning services don\u2019t have Jobs. They are examples of solutions for Job. Products don\u2019t have lives to make better. They also don\u2019t have motivations, aspirations, or struggles. However, people do struggle. They do have lives they want to improve. This is why people\u2014not products\u2014have a JTBD. Competition is defined in the minds of customers, and they use progress as their criterion. Imagine an entrepreneur who wants to be advised and inspired\n\nWhat Are the Principles of Customer Jobs? \n 44 \nby someone whom she respects. She has a variety of options to choose from to achieve this. Examples include reading books, watching videos, attending conferences, or giving advisory shares in exchange for mentorship. The struggling entrepreneur cares little about how she gets advised and inspired. The concern is about making progress. \u201cAre things better for me today than yesterday? Am I getting closer to that picture in my mind of how I want my life to be?\u201d These are some of the criteria customers use to judge which products compete against one another to improve themselves. Customers don\u2019t define or restrict competition based on the functionality or physical appearance of a product. Instead, they use whatever helps them make progress against a JTBD. When customers start using a solution for a JTBD, they stop using something else. Many solo entrepreneurs struggle with feelings of isolation and hope to be motivated and inspired. To get this Job Done, some choose to create local get-togethers through Meetup.com and encourage other solo entrepreneurs to join. If that doesn\u2019t work, they may try getting people together in an online chat group. If that doesn\u2019t work, they may decide to join an existing online community, such as Product People Club. If Product People Club, as a product, is something that works to make their lives better, they stop searching for new solutions. Their Job is Done. These entrepreneurs were jumping from one solution to another. This makes competition for a JTBD a zero-sum game. For somebody to win, somebody else has got to lose. Just as only one puzzle piece can fit into an empty slot, a customer prefers only one solution at a time for a JTBD. Innovation opportunities exist when customers exhibit compensatory behaviors. Baking soda was originally advertised as a baking agent. Over time, customers started using it as a cleaner and deodorizer. Arm & Hammer picked up on this. It now sells a variety of baking soda\u2013based products specialized for various cleaning and deodorizing purposes.18 The Segway was meant to revolutionize personal transportation for the masses. It failed; however, it did find success among members of law enforcement who began using it for their patrols. Tour companies also began using Segways as the ultimate gimmick to attract tourists and for family activities.19 Baking soda and the Segway are examples of customers using products in ways for which they weren\u2019t originally intended. Such situations represent opportunities to innovate a new product or to refit an existing one.",

The ball went into the net; that is a goal. Did you win the game? Are you becoming better at making goals? No one knows. Measure progress instead. Making a goal today isn\u2019t as important as becoming better at making goals in the future. This philosophy is the same for your customers. They don\u2019t wait until after they\u2019ve finished using a product to determine whether they like it. They measure progress along the way. Do people wait until they lose ten pounds before judging whether a gym membership is successful? Customers need to feel successful at every touch point between themselves and your business, not just at the very end when the outcome of an action is realized. Design your product to deliver customers an ongoing feeling of progress. Over time, you will notice that you need to change the outcomes and goals you deliver to customers. Why? A successful product and business will continually improve customers\u2019 lives. As customers use your product to make their lives better, they will face new challenges and desire new goals and outcomes. Progress defines value; contrast reveals value. See how easily you can answer this question: \u201cWhich food do you most prefer: steak or pizza?\u201d Many people find this difficult to answer. An easier question might be, \u201cWhen do you prefer steak, and when do you prefer pizza?\u201d20 A customer may find it difficult to compare two foods without any context. The last question is easier because the person being asked is thinking about food and context together. Products have no value in and of themselves. They have value only when customers use them to make progress. The value of steak is easier to assess when it\u2019s matched with a fancy restaurant and a nice bottle of wine. But things can get wacky in that scenario if we swap a slice of pizza for the steak. The same effect, of course, also applies to pizza. A pizza birthday party for an eight-year-old makes perfect sense, but a steak birthday party for kids doesn\u2019t seem quite right. The kids would probably be upset and the party a disaster. The same steak has more value at the fancy restaurant than at a kid\u2019s birthday party. The steak doesn\u2019t change, but its value does. Why? A steak at a fancy restaurant helps you have a better restaurant experience. It delivers progress. A steak at a child\u2019s birthday party does not make the party better. It does not deliver progress.",

You understand the value customers place on a product when you compare and contrast the progress it delivers against the progress other products can deliver. A steak makes a fancy dinner better but a kid\u2019s birthday party worse. A pizza makes a fancy dinner worse but a kid\u2019s birthday party better. Solutions for Jobs deliver value beyond the moment of use. Imagine you own a car. When it\u2019s sitting in your garage, is it still delivering value? Doesn\u2019t the satisfaction of owning a car extend beyond when you\u2019re actively using it? What\u2019s more valuable: getting transported from point A to point B or having the peace of mind that you have the ability to go where you want to go, whenever you like? Our lives are dynamic. They can\u2019t be measured well in static terms. Yes, a solution can provide functionality only in the moment, but its value to the customer is realized in contexts beyond that moment. A product should be designed with an understanding of how it improves customers\u2019 lives, not just how it offers value in the moment. Producers, consumers, solutions, and Jobs should be thought of as parts of a system that work together to evolve markets. What is a system? A system is a collection of parts that work together to achieve a desired effect. The value is not in any one particular part of the system but in how those parts work together. A car is an example of a system. Imagine I give you a box that contains all the parts of a car. What I gave you would likely be worthless to you. The parts are valuable to you only when they are assembled in a particular fashion, when they work together in a particular way, and when you can use them to make progress. You become better at helping customers, not by studying the individual parts of the car, but by studying how those parts work together to create something that helps customers make progress. The same is true for producers, consumers, solutions, and Consumer Jobs. You need to understand how these parts work together to evolve customers and renew markets. Such a study will also help you understand why and how customers and markets don\u2019t evolve. Grill manufacturer Weber understands the idea of producers, consumers, products, and Jobs as part of a system. Weber understands that it\u2019s not in the business of making and selling grills. It\u2019s in the business of making people better grillers. That\u2019s why it offers educational materials, recipes, party-planning guides, grilling accessories, and even a free phone hotline for grilling advice. For many grillers, the\n\nWhat Are the Principles of Customer Jobs? \n 47 \nJTBD is also about entertaining friends and family with cooking theater, as well as tasty food. In this case, it\u2019s about becoming a better host and entertainer. Weber understands that no matter how well its grills function, if customers can\u2019t use them to make progress against their JTBD, the grills are worthless. The understanding that customers are buying a better version of themselves is why Weber delivers a constellation of products that work together\u2014as parts of a system\u2014to evolve consumers and markets. Weber has been a successful, profitable company since 1893. Use these to create a mental catalog of examples of what it is like to apply Customer Jobs to innovation efforts. This will help you absorb the concepts in this book and become better at applying the theory to your own innovation efforts. After these case studies, we\u2019ll dig deeper into the forces that shape customer demand, why Customer Jobs practitioners claim that Jobs remain while solutions come and go, and what it is like when an innovation effort fails to account for the forces of progress and how customers see competition.\n\n49 \n PART II Demand and Competition Customer Jobs theory encourages you to understand how demand for a product is generated and how customers view competition. The first three chapters in this part feature case studies of innovators who developed this understanding, and how it helped them create and sell products.",

      "text": "51 \n4 CASE STUDY: DAN AND CLARITY What\u2019s the JTBD? Put it to workI didn\u2019t know who Dan Martell was when I started writing this book. Another Customer Jobs practitioner told me about Dan\u2019s success as a serial entrepreneur, angel investor, and Customer Jobs practitioner. When I did catch up with him, I learned that he had applied Customer Jobs principles while building a company called Clarity. Customer Jobs thinking helped him: Improve his research efforts. Understand the company\u2019s profit potential. Understand how Clarity could stand out to customers. Find marketing messages that resonate with customers. Know which features his team should\u2014and shouldn\u2019t\u2014add to his product so that more customers would use it. Founded in 2012, Clarity is a marketplace that connects entrepreneurs with experts who can advise, motivate, and inspire. Dan created Clarity to ensure that entrepreneurs get the advice they need to grow their businesses. It helps them find the right experts and then schedules and hosts calls with them. (Three years later, Dan sold it to Fundable, which is a platform that entrepreneurs can use to raise money.) Dan first heard about Customer Jobs from Eoghan McCabe during Clarity\u2019s early years. Eoghan is CEO of Intercom, one of the companies Dan invests in. Dan, intrigued by Eoghan\u2019s recommendation, believed Customer Jobs could help him grow Clarity faster: Once I decided I wanted to learn more about Customer Jobs, the first thing I did was to search Clarity\u2019s marketplace. I found some [Customer Jobs] experts and did a few calls. It was really helpful to get real-world experience and advice on how to approach it. How can Customer Jobs help you do better research? Dan had already been a strong proponent of customer interviews, even before getting into Customer Jobs.\n\nCase Study: Dan And Clarity \n 52 \nEvery week, he would call six customers or so and ask questions such as, \u201cHow would you feel if you could no longer use this?\u201d or, \u201cHow can we improve Clarity?\u201d But Dan knows that such interviews have limitations. In particular, he understands the difficulties inherent in talking with customers about their habits and that people often want to feel as if they are giving the \u201ccorrect\u201d answers. \u201cI feel like customers have this really bad habit of lying sometimes,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll say, \u2018Yeah. I love your product. I use it all the time.\u2019 Then, you look at the logs, and you realize they haven\u2019t logged in once since signing up\u2014so you know it\u2019s not true.\u201d Calls with JTBD practitioners helped Dan realize the benefits of framing an interview around what Jobs customers are trying to get done. He did this by changing his questions. Instead of \u201cHow would you feel if you could no longer use this?\u201d he asked customers, \u201cCan you tell me about the other solutions you\u2019ve tried? What did, or didn\u2019t you like about each one?\u201d In other words, he shifted from asking broad, individual questions to asking questions aimed at understanding customers\u2019 journeys as they searched to find solutions that fit their JTBD. He would then investigate if other customers had similar journeys. Dan said, What I love about JTBD is that it really helped me to build a framework for those interviews. Before I became familiar with JTBD, I studied interview questions, extracted pain points, customer language, and all these other things. But when you frame it around the question, \u2018What is the Job your customer is hiring you to do?\u2019 then it really puts a lot of things into perspective and helps you uncover key insights. What do consumers consider as competition? How do you understand what customers do and don\u2019t value in a solution? Dan\u2019s new approach to interviewing customers encouraged him to learn about other ways they had tried to get advice. He also wanted to learn if getting expert advice was really what customers were looking for. \u201cGetting expert advice\u201d is just an activity\u2014a solution for a Job. What was the Job itself? What was the emotional motivation to make the customers\u2019 lives better? Answering these questions would help him continue to improve and promote Clarity. To help guide him through these interviews, Dan kept asking himself a few simple but powerful questions: What do customers see as competition to Clarity?",

      "text": "Case Study: Dan And Clarity \n 53 \nWhat would they spend their money on if they didn\u2019t spend it on Clarity? Have customers set aside a budget for using Clarity or some other solution? He then asked customers questions such as the following: What other solutions did you try before deciding on Clarity? What did, and didn\u2019t you like about other solutions you had tried? If you could no longer use Clarity, what would you use instead? These questions helped Dan learn what his customers considered as competition to Clarity. He learned that before ending up with Clarity, customers had tried solutions such as joining entrepreneur groups, hiring individual advisers (who take equity), using LinkedIn, and attending conferences. \u201cUnderstanding how people thought about our product and its competition helped us position it to be different,\u201d Dan said. \u201cA lot of people had tried LinkedIn before coming to Clarity. Whereas LinkedIn connects people, it doesn\u2019t let them call in real time. It was also interesting to hear that customers considered Clarity as an alternative to attending a conference.\u201d How do you learn what pushes customers to make a change? Dan began to learn two important observations as he talked with customers about the solutions they had used: what his customers did and didn\u2019t value in a solution, and what was pushing them to make a change. He found these data by comparing and contrasting all the solutions they had used and asking himself, \u201cWhat do these solutions have (or what do they not have) in common?\u201d Dan realized that the solutions \u201cuse LinkedIn,\u201d \u201chire an adviser,\u201d and \u201cattend a conference\u201d had an important aspect in common: entrepreneurs were trying to make a connection with a specific person. Dan and his team saw that entrepreneurs seeking advice valued the messenger, often more than the message. When it comes to getting advice, it\u2019s not just about the content. It has a lot to do with who\u2019s delivering it. Dan said, There\u2019s real value in going after that person who is going to motivate you to make a change. It\u2019s not just having someone tell you, \u2018Go get ten sales tomorrow.\u2019 It is having billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban tell you, \u2018Go get ten sales tomorrow.\u2019\n\nCase Study: Dan And Clarity \n 54 \nDan now knew what was pushing customers to seek a solution: entrepreneurs who were in a slump wanted inspiration from a particular person. Getting advice is just an activity. If the seekers merely wanted advice, they could have read a book or watched a video. They wanted more. They were hoping that someone else\u2019s success would rub off on them. This is why they wanted someone they respected to inspire and motivate them to get out of an entrepreneurial slump. That was their emotional motivation to make a change. Making progress with this Job is more valuable to these customers than getting advice. Dan said, I\u2019ve got a list of competitors that tried to build competing solutions. Their marketing and positioning was all about, \u2018Oh, if you want to talk to this type of person, we have them.\u2019 But it was never about a person having the knowledge. It was what [you knew] the person you talked with had accomplished. How can understanding the customer\u2019s moment of struggle help you market a solution? These insights helped Dan and his team make two changes to how they advertised Clarity. Each change would differentiate their solution from what customers considered its competition and help customers realize that Clarity was better. The first change was to emphasize that Clarity would serve its customers on demand. As Dan put it: We started saying Clarity gave \u201con-demand business advice.\u201d It was adding the words on demand that differentiated us from LinkedIn\u2014which is an e-mail exchange from which you may or may not get a response. It also differentiated us from attending a conference\u2014you didn\u2019t have to wait until the next one came up. We mentioned all that in the copywriting. The second change was to highlight the fact that using Clarity was cheaper than attending a conference. Dan said, \u201cUnderstanding what customers considered as competition also helped us position Clarity against the cost of going to a conference. Why invest thousands of dollars in expenses and the cost of a ticket if you can just talk to the speaker today?\u201d How did the product attract more users and customers? Clarity is a marketplace for connecting buyers (entrepreneurs looking for advice) with sellers (those offering advice). This means that Clarity needed to attract two different groups of people\u2014each with its own motivation for using Clarity.",

      "text": "Case Study: Dan And Clarity \n 55 \nThe motivation for advisers is simple: they want to make money by helping people. The entrepreneurs who use Clarity, however, are different. They want to be motivated and inspired, usually by a particular person. This meant that for its marketplace function to work, Clarity had to find experts whom customers recognized and respected. Dan said, Understanding what customers were trying to achieve with LinkedIn and conferences helped us with the supply side of the marketplace. We said to ourselves, \u201cOK, if we recruit experts, we need to recruit a certain type of expert.\u201d One of the creative solutions that we came up with was to source experts from SlideShare (a website where conference speakers share their presentations with the public). If you think about it, people who are regarded as inspiring and motivational are those who give creative presentations at conferences. When we wanted to add topics or categories for Clarity, we would source experts who had presentations on SlideShare. How did Clarity realize its revenue potential? It was Dan\u2019s understanding of what customers considered as Clarity\u2019s competition that also helped him realize Clarity\u2019s revenue potential: We learned from customers that their budget for Clarity wasn\u2019t coming from the IPO, or from a monthly membership, or from a training budget. It was coming from spending money to go to an event to meet people and to learn. Dan realized that Clarity wasn\u2019t taking money away only from lower-cost alternatives, such as LinkedIn, or from the price of a conference ticket. He learned that Clarity was tapping into the budgets for big-ticket items, such as hiring advisers and consultants, as well as entire budgets for attending conferences, which include airfare, hotels, and meals. This explained why his customers were willing to spend thousands of dollars on calls. This insight helped him understand how valuable his product was to customers. It also helped him understand Clarity\u2019s true value in case it was acquired, which it eventually was. Clarity discovered a silent competitor: anxiety. Nobody comes to Clarity when he or she is having a great day. Dan and his team learned that entrepreneurs were hoping they could get inspired by someone they respected. Without this inspiration, these entrepreneurs would struggle to put into action any advice they were given. This generated demand for the product. But were there any forces that blocked this demand? Dan said, \u201cThe biggest competition for us is when a customer",

In Clarity\u2019s case, entrepreneurs and innovators continue struggling in the dark. They wouldn\u2019t choose to become a self-educator and solve their problem.\u201d Dan began to learn about the anxiety that blocks people from using the product or keeps them from using it more, even when they do decide to reach out to an expert on Clarity: One of the questions that I would ask, which was about Clarity as a solution and not their JTBD, was, \u201cWhat can we change to better meet your needs?\u201d We found a bunch of anxieties around using Clarity. A majority of them were, \u201cWhat if the expert doesn\u2019t answer my question? What\u2019s your guarantee? Is the call going to be recorded? What should I do to prep?\u201d That last was one that really threw me off. Both the seekers and experts themselves felt we should teach them how to prepare for a good call. Dan and his team had taken it for granted that people would be prepared for a call. He assumed that both parties would set up the topic and then have a conversation. This was partly true. Customers had specific questions, but they didn\u2019t know how to organize them or what made a question good or bad. Both sides wanted to prep, but they didn\u2019t know how. Another anxiety that both parties shared was the fear of sounding stupid or not putting their best foot forward. What if an expert doesn\u2019t have a good answer for a question? What if he or she temporarily forgets the best answer? What if I get nervous and forget my follow-up questions? These anxieties prevented both groups\u2014entrepreneurs and experts\u2014from using Clarity more. How can you reduce the anxiety customers face when using or buying your product? To fix the problem, Dan and his team added some prep questions and guidelines to the e-mail templates they sent out to notify both parties of a call. They also provided notes that outlined what a great call looks like and what expectations the parties should have going into the call. Dan said, Discovering anxieties like those\u2014that is the interesting part. What I love is thinking, \u2018Here is the problem, and here is the anxiety point. How do we solve it in a way that\u2019s elegant, simple, and doesn\u2019t confuse the interface?\u2019 That was always the fun part for me.",

As Dan became more familiar with JTBD, he began to develop his own tools and processes that would help him apply JTBD principles to improve Clarity. One such process was aimed at helping his team quickly validate ideas for new features. Before committing to developing a feature, the Clarity team wanted to make sure the problem they intended to solve was actually one that customers had. The best way to learn this was to find out if customers had tried to solve the problem before. Dan said, \u201cAn interview about how customers had tried to solve a problem in the past was more like a feature-usage time line than a purchase decision.\u201d An example of a feature the Clarity team chose not to build was one that saved search results when users looked for experts on Clarity\u2019s marketplace. We asked customers questions like, \u201cHave you ever tried to save results when you searched for an expert?\u201d If they said no, then we\u2019d move on. We then asked, \u201cDo you have a browser bookmarklet? Which ones?\u201d Then, they would say, \u201cEvernote, Buffer\u2026\u201d It would provide so much context outside of the feature. It was more about how the customer had tried to solve their problems in the past. So, Dan\u2019s team decided not to build the browser bookmarklet. They didn\u2019t think it delivered enough value because the problem it solved wasn\u2019t one their customers had struggled with. Dan said, A lot of people\u2014especially if they\u2019re committed or already invested in a solution\u2014are looking for that confirmation bias that it\u2019s something they should do. It\u2019s a different question to ask customers how they solved the problem in the past. I could ask them, \u201cHey, what do you think of this?\u201d They might say, \u201cOh, it\u2019s prettier. It works great.\u201d But that\u2019s not really answering the question we\u2019re asking. We want to know, \u201cAre you going to use it? Are you struggling to make progress? Have you tried to solve this in the past? Do you want to hire someone or something to solve this Job to be Done?\u201d If the answer is no, then cool. We write that down and move on. How does JTBD help innovators? Dan appreciates the focus JTBD puts on exploring customer motivation. He also wishes more companies would do that rather than \u201cspy\u201d on customers.\n\nCase Study: Dan And Clarity \n 58 \nI think the biggest thing that Jobs [JTBD] encourages people to do, which I\u2019m a big fan of, is to stop spying on customers and start talking with customers. I feel that way especially with software because we have the analytics and the geeks who are building the software; they\u2019re all about tracking and logging and all these data\u2026I always give the analogy of being a retail shop owner and hiding in the back room and trying to learn from your customers by watching the closed-circuit television. You could watch [customers] come in, walk around your store, pick up things, put them down, try things on\u2026or you could just walk out and ask them, \u201cHey, what brought you in here today? What are you looking for? What other places did you try in the past?\u201d Talking to customers about their motivations is where you\u2019re going to learn the most. \nWHAT\u2019S THE JTBD? From the data Dan has given us, I\u2019d say that the desire for progress is as follows: More about: getting out of a rut, making a connection with someone whose accomplishments I respect, being inspired, being motivated to act, feeling like I\u2019m on the right path, having confidence in what I\u2019m doing, having success rub off on me, on demand. Less about: getting expert advice, talking with an expert, giving away equity, having a video chat with a mentor, e-mailing a mentor, mentoring, meeting other entrepreneurs, seeing a mentor live. Here are some possible descriptions of the one or more Jobs to be Done Clarity is hired for: Help me get out of an innovation slump with inspirational advice from someone whom I respect. Give me the motivation to act with a kick in the butt from someone I respect. Take away the anxiety of making a big decision with assurance from someone else whose has been in a similar position.",

      "text": "Case Study: Dan And Clarity \n 59 \nThese work for me because they don\u2019t describe an activity or task. They describe the motivation that comes before engaging in an activity (i.e., using a solution). Also, notice how these descriptions can be used to describe the other solutions customers had tried in the past (e.g., attending a conference, giving away advisory shares, and using LinkedIn). This is important because a JTBD either doesn\u2019t change or does so slowly. If a description of a JTBD works for solutions from one hundred years ago, it\u2019ll probably work for solutions one hundred years into the future. \nPUT IT TO WORK Dan\u2019s case study is a great introduction to Customer Jobs. Here are some suggestions to help you get started today with applying Customer Jobs thinking. Ask customers about what they\u2019ve done, not just what they want. Confirm it if you can. Customers will often tell us what we want to hear, even if it\u2019s partially (or completely) untrue. Customers may tell you that they use your product \u201call the time,\u201d but they really use it only intermittently. Also, people build easy-to-remember narratives between themselves and the products they use. Phenomena like this are why it\u2019s tricky to ask customers, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d and \u201cHow can we make things better?\u201d21 The answer for these problems is to talk with customers about what they actually did, not just about what they say they want. What were their revealed preferences, not just their stated preferences? Even the answers about actual action taken won\u2019t be 100 percent accurate, but they will be a great deal more reliable than their answers to what-if questions.22 Understanding how customers have solved problems is a crucial part of understanding their JTBD. Not only does it help you understand what customers expect from a product, but it also helps you design features for new products. Ask the right questions to learn how your customers view competition. Accurate models of competition can come from only customers. Any model of competition that doesn\u2019t come from them is invalid. One way of getting the information you need to build a correct model of competition is through customer interviews and surveys. Ask them questions such as the following: What other solutions did you consider before trying the product? What other solutions have you actually used?\n\nCase Study: Dan And Clarity \n 60 \nIf the product wasn\u2019t available to you, what would you have done instead? What solutions have the people you know tried or used? Learn what kind of progress customers are seeking. What\u2019s their emotional motivation (JTBD)? Use that to segment competition. Dan learned that Clarity\u2019s customers saw its competition as attending conferences, using LinkedIn, and hiring advisers. These solutions have vastly different functionality and qualities. However, from the customers\u2019 point of view, they appeal to the same aspiration: \u201cGet me out of an entrepreneurial slump with motivational advice from someone whom I respect.\u201d Discover your customers\u2019 motivation through comparing and contrasting the solutions that they consider as competition: What do the various solutions have in common? What is different about them? What did, or didn\u2019t the customers like about each solution? What would customers do if they couldn\u2019t use their existing solution for their JTBD? What would the consequences be? How are they expecting life to be better once they have the right solution for a JTBD? These types of questions help you understand two things: what customers are struggling with now, and how they hope life will be better when they have the right solution. Put these two together, and you\u2019ll have their JTBD. Ask yourself, \u201cFrom which budget will my product take away money?\u201d Also ask, \u201cWhen customers start using my product, what will they stop using?\u201d Dan learned that his customers were willing to spend thousands of dollars on Clarity calls. This number didn\u2019t come from looking at how much other \u201ctalk to an expert\u201d products cost. He learned this by understanding that his product\u2014from the customers\u2019 point of view\u2014was replacing the entire budget of going to a conference. I\u2019ve noted that when it comes to solutions for a JTBD, customers can use only one at a time. When they start using one solution, they have to stop using something else. This helps you understand what the competition is. It also helps you gauge",

      "text": "Case Study: Dan And Clarity \n 61 \nhow to price your product properly and figure your revenue potential. Should you charge less or more? You have two big factors to consider: the amount customers are already accustomed to spending on a solution for a JTBD, and the intensity of their desire to change. The more they hope to change, the more they are willing to pay. Create better marketing material by speaking to your customers\u2019 JTBD. Dan Martell described Clarity as \u201con-demand business advice.\u201d He also featured access to experts whom customers would recognize. He also positioned Clarity as an alternative to going to a conference: Why spend the time and money going to a conference? Talk with the speaker today! Both of these messages spoke to customers\u2019 motivations and distinguished Clarity as unique. Talk with customers to learn what messages connect with them. It can be as simple as asking them to describe why they like your product. Sometimes, you have to probe deeper and ask them questions such as, \u201cBefore you bought our product, how did you know it was right for you?\u201d The best promotional material, however, comes from speaking directly to their desire for progress. Focus on delivering emotional progress (getting a Job Done). Don\u2019t focus solely on functionality. Dan mentioned a list of people who had tried to create solutions similar to Clarity. They failed, and Clarity won because Dan designed and marketed it in a way that spoke to customers\u2019 emotional motivation. The Clarity clones thought of themselves as \u201ctalk to an expert\u201d products; they were focusing on functionality, activities, and tasks. But Dan focused on the emotional quality\u2014that is, customers\u2019 JTBD. He knew that customers wanted to be motivated and inspired by someone whom they respect. This made Clarity stand out, and it\u2019s why Fundable acquired it. Clarity\u2019s former competitors, however, have already been forgotten. Your guiding star in understanding your customers\u2019 JTBD is their motivation to better their lives. Focus on that. Focusing on functionality will distract you.\n\n62 \n5 CASE STUDY: ANTHONY AND FORM THEATRICALS What\u2019s the JTBD? Put it to workWhat progress might someone use theater for? I had never asked this question before, but Anthony Francavilla had. For the past few years, Anthony has been applying Customer Jobs principles to figure out the answers to that question. Theater has been around for thousands of years. Shouldn\u2019t we know the reasons why people attend the theater? Maybe. But maybe not. Anthony has managed and produced theater for ten years. In 2012, he cofounded Form Theatricals, whose mission is to help productions grow and be successful. This is particularly challenging in the theater world. Many productions are run by actors or writers who often don\u2019t have much business experience. They also have little to no experience innovating around customer motivation. This is where Anthony and Form Theatricals come in. Customer Jobs has helped Anthony figure out how to learn what really matters to theatergoers; what customers do and don\u2019t consider as competition to theater; and how a theater production could improve its shows for patrons, increase profits from ticket sales, develop new types of theater products, and reduce the cost of operating a show. Why look into Customer Jobs? Anthony knew that interviewing theater patrons was the key to improving a show. But what\u2019s the best way to interview people about a show they\u2019ve just seen? To find out, he sought advice from someone who specializes in interviewing customers. Anthony said, I got together with this guy, Boris, who specializes in ethnographic interviewing. I said to him, \u201cI have this problem with a client. People don\u2019t like the show, but it\u2019s selling well. I want to interview customers, but I don\u2019t know what I should be asking them about.\u201d He said I could talk to them and try to find out what Job these patrons are trying to get Done. He asked me if I had heard about Customer Jobs. I told him I hadn\u2019t. He explained it to me. Then, he told me about some sources online where I could learn more. I also signed up for the Customer Jobs Meetup that\u2019s run here in New York.",

Studying what customers consider as competition helps you reveal what pushes them to change. It also helps reveal their JTBD. Anthony applied some Customer Jobs thinking to his next client: a children\u2019s theater company. To begin, he interviewed parents who had taken their children to the company\u2019s show. He wanted to know why they chose this particular show. Did they consider any other activities for their children besides attending the theater? He told me, \u201cWe interviewed a bunch of parents. We learned that the options they had considered [as alternatives to attending the theater] ranged from going to The LEGO Movie and buying the LEGO video game to signing their children up to clubs\u2014like the Girl Scouts.\u201d This was a story Anthony kept hearing. Parents were considering a wide array of options as alternatives to taking their children to this particular theater show. Or, in Customer Jobs terms, he learned exactly what parents considered as competition for their JTBD. These customers surely used the theater for other Jobs in other circumstances. But in this case, what Job were they hoping to get Done by bringing their children to this show? To help him answer this question, Anthony applied Customer Jobs\u2019 idea of \u201ccontrast reveals value.\u201d He talked with these parents about what they did or didn\u2019t like about the other options they had considered. What can the theater do for them that an alternative solution\u2014such as the Girl Scouts\u2014can\u2019t? He also asked these parents about what they did immediately after the shows. Did they have family discussions about them? What were those discussions like? After talking with numerous parents, he began to see a distinct pattern. \u201cWe found out that part of the Job these parents are trying to get done\u2014when it comes to entertainment and activities for their kids\u2014was that they wanted help teaching their kids how to be independent\u2026while also reinforcing that they are a member of a team.\u201d How do you go about making product changes when you understand the customers\u2019 desire for progress? Anthony brought these insights to his client. Together, they decided to rewrite parts of the play. They kept most of the content the same, but they added a story arc wherein the hero works with the characters around him to solve a problem. This would give parents a talking point with their children about the importance of working with others. Anthony said,",

      "text": "Case Study: Anthony and Form Theatricals \n 64 \nIt\u2019s interesting to me because helping writers understand what Job parents are using their play for is more powerful than saying to them, \u201cWrite a movie, or write a play that a nine-year-old will like.\u201d When we know that parents have a Job that involves their desire to teach their children life lessons in an entertaining way, we can work with our clients to help them craft their content better. When we present it as a Job to be Done, the artist has a lot of leeway around what the story should do. For Anthony\u2019s client to sell more tickets to these parents, the performances had to help parents make progress against their JTBD, which included their aspiration to be responsible parents, as well as becoming better at teaching life lessons to their children. This needed to be done in a way that their kids would enjoy. The performance also had to do this better than what parents considered as competition\u2014namely, other plays, movies, video games, and clubs. Anthony wouldn\u2019t have got the same depth of insight had he interviewed parents only about what they did and didn\u2019t like about the play. Had he done that, he would have ended up getting a lot of feedback about how to make the play better\u2014but only in comparison with other plays. With a Customer Jobs approach to understanding competition, he was now learning how theater compared with other solutions customers had tried. What do we gain from digging deeper into the JTBD? Anthony wasn\u2019t satisfied with just the one insight that these parents wanted help teaching their children life lessons. He wanted to dig deeper into their motivation. Were there other ways they were hoping that theater would make their lives better? He said, One of the things we figured out was that parents want to have shared experiences with their kids. That\u2019s not necessarily understood by the producers of theater and movies. On the surface, it doesn\u2019t seem like a shared experience. Theater productions often see the dynamic of a play as \u201cLet\u2019s just go sit in a dark room and watch this together.\u201d What we learned\u2014and what a lot people don\u2019t realize\u2014is that the shared experience actually happens after the show. It\u2019s when everyone goes out for dinner and they talk about the movie or the play they just saw. This insight about shared experiences prompted Anthony to ask parents other questions. What were other shared experiences they engaged in with their children? How did theater fit into those?",

      "text": "Case Study: Anthony and Form Theatricals \n 65 \nI interviewed this father about how he, his wife, and his child would pick what they were going to watch on TV. They were basically engaged in rhetoric; they would each debate what they wanted to watch. They\u2019d go back and forth, to the point that sometimes the debate would end with them all deciding to just go their separate ways and reading their own books. They wanted to have a shared experience\u2014to the point that the debate itself became the shared experience\u2014and they didn\u2019t end up watching anything on TV. By comparing and contrasting how families had and felt about shared experiences, Anthony could begin to understand what customers did and didn\u2019t like about each solution. What made discussion about what to watch on TV so successful? What things didn\u2019t families like about it? What were family discussions like after the family saw a play together? Were these discussions about life lessons or about other things, such as the performances of the actors? How could a theater show promote better conversations at home? Answers to these questions helped Anthony understand that these parents wanted to make family life better through engaging and educational discussions with their children. These conversations were a bonding experience. This was exactly the kind of direction his client needed. It helped the children\u2019s theater company make script adjustments, so its plays could act as vehicles for family conversations. How many Jobs might an innovation be used for? Anthony\u2019s interviews with families had been successful. Understanding what Jobs they were using theater for helped him provide guidance for his client. He decided to continue Customer Jobs research with his other clients. The next few shows he worked on were drama pieces with more serious subject matter\u2014definitely not for kids. Patrons were usually individuals or small groups of friends. What Job might these people be using theater for? Anthony said, We interviewed a banker who went to a show by himself. He said, \u201cI love these weird off-off-Broadway plays.\u201d As we dived deeper into what that meant, we began to realize that an important part of the theater experience was who else is in the audience. That\u2019s what one group of customers was looking for. They would say, \u201cI want to hang out with artists more.\u201d Others would say, \u201cIt\u2019s just amazing. I don\u2019t normally sit in a room and have an experience with a group of diverse people like that.\u201d",

      "text": "Case Study: Anthony and Form Theatricals \n 66 \nThis is how Anthony began to discover another Job that people use theater for: it was about being a part of, or dipping their toes into, a different community. Very often, these customers had careers that weren\u2019t arts related, such as banking or law. He would hear comments such as \u201cI like these productions that are a bit out there,\u201d \u201cI like going because there are artists in the audience. They\u2019re talking about art,\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t have a job in the arts, but I love the arts. I want to be involved in that kind of scene.\u201d For many of these patrons, going to these shows was their only opportunity to engage with a diverse group of people. They liked the arts. They wanted to be involved in that community. Anthony said, That was a very impactful insight. A lot of times, the theater will try to sell you the idea that it\u2019s like a movie\u2014but on stage. You can\u2019t compete with that. Theater is more expensive. It\u2019s sometimes super-inconvenient to attend a show. I have Netflix. If I want to watch a movie, I can hit a button, and there is a movie. Figuring out what Job live entertainment solves for people in the twenty-first century is exciting. We\u2019ve learned that, yes, it is entertainment, but it\u2019s also about this idea of community. It\u2019s something that you\u2019re going to enjoy with other people. Maybe there will also be drinks, food, a lively atmosphere\u2014all that kind of stuff. That\u2019s something that a theater can take and use to build up a new business model for the twenty-first century\u2014as opposed to this idea that there\u2019s going to be a celebrity in the show. Tickets for those shows are two hundred and fifty dollars. There\u2019s a very limited audience for that. How can Customer Jobs help you reimagine existing products? With these new insights, Anthony and his clients were able to create a new type of theater experience: a theater subscription product. When people buy these subscriptions, each person is put into a specific cohort of customers. Shows are picked out for these customers. Over several months, this same group of people sees the same shows and engages in social events around the show. Anthony said, These patrons valued this idea of inclusiveness. It is important for us to help theater productions understand that patrons are looking for an inclusive experience. This meant making the subscription affordable. It\u2019s easier for a banker to pay five hundred dollars for a few shows than it is for many artists. We solved this problem by offering multiple payment options. You could spread the price over months or pay for the whole subscription up front.",

Anthony didn\u2019t help his clients by only suggesting to them what they should add to a show. He also made suggestions on what to take out of it. One of Anthony\u2019s clients had a production that featured an after-the-show tour of the stage for anyone who attended. It was something the producers of the show were proud of. But did patrons enjoy it? As he interviewed patrons after the show, he learned that most of them hadn\u2019t known about the tour when they bought their tickets. They had simply chosen the show because tickets were being sold at a discount. He said, The majority of these patrons learned about the show and the discount on the day of the show. For some of them, it had been a last-minute decision. They\u2019d be discussing with friends what to do for the evening. Should they just go to a bar? A comedy club? But when they noticed the discounted theater tickets, they then chose to buy tickets. It could be an hour or two before the show started. Of all the people he interviewed, only one or two knew that the set tour was going to happen. Anthony\u2019s client had assumed that theater patrons were interested in access to the actors and seeing how the show worked. As it happened, almost no one who bought a ticket knew about the tour. The tour hadn\u2019t been part of these patrons\u2019 purchase criteria, so it didn\u2019t help explain why they were hiring the show. Anthony said, We learned that people were not hiring the show to get access to the actors and set after the show. Finding that piece of information was very valuable. The after-show tour was expensive to maintain, and it wasn\u2019t something patrons were particularly interested in. The Job for those patrons was about entertainment and having a shared experience with their friends and significant others. In this case, the producers had overengineered the show. They had designed the show based on what they valued\u2014a tour of the set\u2014instead of what their customers valued\u2014having a shared, fun experience with their friends. After gaining these insights, Anthony worked with the producers to discontinue the set tours. While experimentation is good, it has to be within the constraints of the Job that customers are hiring the show for. The new thinking freed up the show\u2019s designers to focus on what they were doing right and make that better.",

      "text": "Case Study: Anthony and Form Theatricals \n 68 \nHow does anxiety stop customers from buying your product? Is there really such a thing as an \u201cimpulse purchase\u201d? Similar to tickets for airplanes, sporting events, and movies, theater tickets are worthless after the event starts. Seats are perishable inventory. This posed an interesting challenge for Anthony and his clients. To help him figure out how his clients could sell more tickets, he began interviewing customers to learn more about the key events that sped up or slowed down a decision to buy a ticket. Were there any anxieties about attending a particular show? If so, how could a theater production solve this problem? Anthony said, For each customer, we mapped out a time line of the events that led up to their ticket purchase. We began to hear the same things over and over again. Things like, a husband reads a magazine with his friends at work\u2014that\u2019s where he\u2019ll first find out about a play. He\u2019ll e-mail his wife about it. She\u2019ll respond with a comment like, \u201cSeems interesting. I like that it\u2019s a horror-themed play set in Spanish. I like horror.\u201d But when bad reviews for it come out, they start to doubt if they\u2019ll like it. But they still keep an eye on the show. Then, maybe a week later, they\u2019ll learn about the discount. At that minute, they\u2019re pushed over the edge and buy the tickets. Anthony discovered two insights here: some anxieties prevent customers from buying tickets to a show, and tickets that seem to be impulse purchases sometimes aren\u2019t. The majority of customers who bought a ticket through a discount did so on the day of the show, but that doesn\u2019t mean these were impulse purchases. In the backs of their minds, these customers already had specific shows they wanted to see. But what was holding them back from buying the tickets? Anxiety. They\u2019d first be excited about a show\u2019s concept, but if reviews weren\u2019t positive, they\u2019d hold off. The discount, however, could compress the purchase time line. It eased anxiety and caused potential patrons to buy. Can Customer Jobs theory gather new insights about a medium that is thousands of years old? As the competition for theater changes with the advance of technology, it\u2019s important to focus on the Jobs that customers hire theater for. Many parents use it as a way to help them have the types of conversations they want with their children and to help them teach life lessons. For those who want to expand and bring diversity to their social circles, community and diversity are critical.\n\nCase Study: Anthony and Form Theatricals \n 69 \nAnthony\u2019s application of JTBD principles and focusing on customer motivation have enabled him to innovate within a medium that is thousands of years old. \nWHAT\u2019S THE JTBD? This case study reveals different directions of progress that people hope to make using theater. This would explain why there are so many different types of theater shows. Some big themes associated with Jobs to Be Done I heard include using shared experiences to create or strengthen bonds with family and friends, parents teaching their children life lessons, and adding excitement to your social life by getting involved with people whom you normally wouldn\u2019t interact with. The clearest JTBD I heard was related to parents\u2019 desires. They wanted to teach their children how to be independent, while also understanding how to work with others. This works for solutions such as video games, movies, clubs like the Girl Scouts, and attending the theater. This case study had some great data about customer motivation; however, I still have questions about these parents\u2019 motivations: What are some of the consequences of not teaching their children life lessons? Is there something in these parents\u2019 lives that is pushing them to make a change now, or are they deciding to be proactive and avoid feeling guilty in the future? Does having conversations about life lessons relate to anything else going on in the lives of these parents or children? What about school or interactions with their friends? What other solutions do parents couple with theater to make progress? How will parents know their Job is Done? That is, when do they know they are making progress and things are getting better? I would have a better idea of what progress parents are trying to make once I had answers to questions such as these.",

      "text": "Case Study: Anthony and Form Theatricals \n 70 \nPUT IT TO WORK How do you persuade teammates or management to change a product? Frame design challenges as a JTBD. Innovators like to solve problems; we don\u2019t like being told what to do. I find it\u2019s best to motivate a team by presenting them with problems to solve in the form of a customer\u2019s JTBD. Dig deeper when you tap into a struggle or aspiration. How have customers tried to solve it before? Anthony discovered that parents had a desire for shared experiences with their kids. But what does shared experiences mean? It turns out that a shared experience is most important after the show. This insight gave Anthony the idea to talk with other patrons about their shared experiences. What made a shared experience successful? How had the patrons tried to have shared experiences? When customers describe a struggle or aspiration, don\u2019t make assumptions about what they mean; rather, unpack what they\u2019re saying. Ask for specific examples. If they describe a struggle, how do they imagine life being better once they solve it? If they describe an aspiration, what are the consequences if they can\u2019t achieve it? The answers will help you make design, marketing, and business decisions. Discover what customers value. Learn their expectations at the moment of purchase and/or first use and avoid overengineering solutions. Anthony had a client who offered a costly after-the-show tour of the set. However, he learned that almost no patrons were aware that the tour was being offered, so it didn\u2019t affect their purchase decisions. This made it safe to remove tours from the show. This reduced costs of production, and it increased profits. A great deal of waste happens when solutions are developed with features that customers don\u2019t value. Customers value the progress a feature may deliver, not the feature itself. If you have an existing product, engage in an audit to determine which features don\u2019t help customers make progress toward their JTBD. If you\u2019re about to create a new feature, make sure it delivers progress and, more importantly, helps you increase profits. You might learn just as one of Anthony\u2019s clients did\u2014namely, that you\u2019re spending money to support features that customers don\u2019t find valuable. Determine if anxiety is a competitor. If it is, find ways of reducing it. You should attack the anxieties in choosing and using a product with the same fervor as attacking a competing product. If customers have anxiety over the cost-value\n\nCase Study: Anthony and Form Theatricals \n 71 \nrelationship of your product, offer a discount. If customers experience anxiety in using your product, find a way to make your product less intimidating. Anthony attacked the former by offering discounts on the day of the show. He attacked the latter by offering drinks as \u201cliquid courage\u201d for theater patrons to feel more comfortable mingling with one another. Be suspicious of the \u201cimpulse purchase\u201d concept. No purchase is random. Anthony discovered that many customers purchased tickets on the day of\u2014or even an hour or two before\u2014the shows. But that doesn\u2019t mean that these were impulse purchases. Many patrons had already decided they wanted to see a show; they had reservations about paying full price for a show that had received mixed reviews. A lowered price helped ease their anxiety about paying for a show that might not be very good. Talk with customers about how they came to choose your product for their JTBD. They might claim that their purchase of a USB charging cable was \u201cjust an impulse purchase while I was waiting in line.\u201d However, when you dig deeper, you might learn that they were about to go on a trip and wanted to take an inexpensive charging cable with them in case it got lost during their travels.",

      "text": "72 \nCASE STUDY: MORGAN AND YOURGROCER What\u2019s the JTBD? Put it to workMorgan Ranieri was fed up. Getting home from work at seven o\u2019clock at night meant he couldn\u2019t get the groceries he wanted, for the stores he wanted to shop at were closed by then. Instead, he had to settle for the supermarket chains around Melbourne, Australia, where Morgan lives. I say \u201csettle\u201d because the food quality at these supermarkets isn\u2019t very good. Shopping there also meant he wasn\u2019t supporting family businesses, which was something he liked to do. Sensing that he shared this struggle with other people, he teamed up with his colleague Bandith and created YourGrocer. The concept for YourGrocer was simple: have your groceries delivered to you from local, high-quality food shops. Over the next few months, Morgan and Bandith did some tests to see if the YourGrocer concept could work. They investigated what the competition might be, what logistics would need to be in place, and how many local shops were interested in partnering with them, and they even did some preliminary testing with a few customers to get feedback. Their tests told them that an opportunity did exist. However, to grow their business, Morgan and Bandith needed someone with more technical expertise to join the team. Morgan met Francisco (Frankie) Trindade at a local Meetup. Morgan said, \u201cOver the next month or so, we began speed dating, in a sense\u2014getting to know one another before deciding to work together.\u201d In this case study, we learn how Customer Jobs helped Morgan build a consensus among team members, what customers did and didn\u2019t value in a solution, find the right marketing messages, how it helped first-time customers switch to Morgan\u2019s product, and how he could reduce churn. Customer Jobs helps you persuade others that an opportunity exists. Frankie wanted to make sure an opportunity existed before he joined YourGrocer as its third cofounder. This is when Frankie introduced Morgan to Customer Jobs. Frankie told Morgan that he wanted to spend more time learning what Job(s) customers would use YourGrocer for. He especially wanted to do this before writing any of the software that would power the business. Morgan said,\n\nCase Study: Morgan and YourGrocer \n 73 \nIt was Frankie who introduced me and Bandith to Jobs (Customer Jobs). Actually, the first thing Frankie did when he joined YourGrocer was to make sure we all understood the principles of Customer Jobs. We spent a week learning about it and figuring out how we would interview customers. All of us learning about Customer Jobs, and then interviewing twenty customers together, was a great way to induct him as YourGrocer\u2019s third cofounder. How does your team benefit from doing Customer Jobs research together? The newly formed YourGrocer team gained an unexpected benefit of doing Customer Jobs research together. As Morgan said, This shared learning experience really helped bring us together. We developed a shared understanding of what the business needed to be\u2014which was missing in the beginning. At the start, we all had very different ideas about what customers were struggling with and how we should solve it. I was the typical visionary cofounder who has the next five years planned out in my head\u2014which is very dangerous. But Frankie didn\u2019t make many assumptions. He wanted to take it one step at a time. His middle name should be \u201cPragmatic\u201d: Frankie Pragmatic. Interviewing about twenty customers got me, as a business cofounder, and Frankie, as a new technical cofounder, on to the same page. Are data about \u201ctypes\u201d of people information or misinformation? The first aha moment for the YourGrocer team was when they realized that their customers didn\u2019t match the assumed demographic. Morgan said, We had an assumption about what our customer demographic was\u2014or the idea of who our target customer was. The reality turned out to be quite different. We thought we were creating a business for young professionals who wanted to buy groceries online. It turns out, almost every single one of our customers was a young family\u2014typically a young mom with a couple of kids at home. At first, the YourGrocer team created the business out of their own need\u2014that is, a way for busy young professionals to buy groceries online. But because most of the company\u2019s customers were young families, the team needed to adjust. \u201cIt just turned out that the type of customers we were targeting at first [young professionals] didn\u2019t really work too well for our product, but this other group of customers [parents] was ripe for it.\u201d",

      "text": "Case Study: Morgan and YourGrocer \n 74 \nHow do struggling moments arise? What is it like to be pushed to change? Morgan and his team had now picked up on a group of struggling customers. The next step was to learn how and why these people were struggling. What was the struggling moment? This meant that Morgan first needed to talk with these customers about the different ways they had purchased groceries before. Morgan began to uncover the triggering events that would push these customers from one solution to another. The push that eventually led our customers to YourGrocer often began a couple of years in the past. They\u2019d start off shopping at the shops they liked. Then they\u2019d have their first child. Getting around to these shops with one kid was difficult, but they could deal with it. But once they had their second child, that would really change things. Having a second kid made it almost impossible to get to the local shops they wanted. That\u2019s when they switched from their local shops to buying at the two big suppliers here. As a customer\u2019s family grew, more of his or her time was dedicated to caregiving. It also made traveling to multiple food shops difficult. This would lead these families to consider other ways of getting their groceries, such as at supermarkets. Discovering these triggering events helped Morgan understand how demand was being generated and how it pushed these parents to seek a solution. This helped him get an idea of how these parents were trying to make their lives better\u2014that is, what Job they were trying to get Done. What is it like to learn what customers do and don\u2019t like about solutions they\u2019ve tried? Next, Morgan had to learn how these parents had already tried to solve their problem\u2014namely, how to get groceries when they had children to take care of. Comparing and contrasting these solutions would help him understand what these customers did and didn\u2019t value in a solution. In particular, these parents complained about cost, poor-quality food, and not being able to choose foods they wanted. The big supermarkets do fresh produce badly. The other local delivery suppliers that do fresh produce well are expensive. Some of them even have these subscription models where you get a preselected assortment of groceries. Customers can\u2019t pick and choose what they want, when they want it. Our customers didn\u2019t like that. They were getting a bunch of stuff they didn\u2019t want, not using it, having it all go bad, and getting frustrated by that. Often, all these issues with other services\n\nCase Study: Morgan and YourGrocer \n 75 \nhad been going on for some time. They were just putting up with it. Then, we came along. It was just what they had been waiting for. What are examples of things customers value? Before starting YourGrocer, Morgan and his team already had a pretty good idea of what the business would be: home delivery from the quality shops his customers loved. Now they were filling in any blanks and confirming their assumptions of the value that YourGrocer should deliver. Here\u2019s what they were learning: Convenience had become these customers\u2019 top priority. They used to value food quality the most, but traveling with their kids to multiple stores proved too difficult for them. This pushed them to trade food quality for convenience.23 After convenience, they wanted to be able to choose foods they wanted. This ruled out services that delivered to the home but didn\u2019t allow buyers to choose their own food options. Quality got pushed to the bottom. Ultimately, these customers ended up choosing food from supermarkets. While supermarkets offered the lowest-quality foods, they ranked the highest on convenience and selection. How does JTBD help you create a message that connects with customers? The YourGrocer team members were confident that they now understood what the customers valued and that the team could deliver this value. The next step was to figure out a message that would connect with customers. Once again, customer interviews helped Morgan and his team figure this out. In the beginning, we didn\u2019t know which messages would stick with customers. We would say, \u201cIt\u2019s good to shop locally, because it\u2019s good for the environment. It\u2019s better food. It\u2019s better priced. It\u2019s convenient. It\u2019s local shops. It\u2019s good for your community.\u201d We were throwing out half a dozen different messages out there without knowing which ones would persuade customers to try us. Morgan solved this problem by asking his customers JTBD-style questions, such as \u201cWhat stood out to you about us?\u201d As he did so, he began to gain rich details about customers\u2019 motivations.",

We would ask them, \u201cWhat did you tell your friends about YourGrocer?\u201d Or, better yet, \u201cCan you show me the text in your phone that you sent your friend about us?\u201d Morgan\u2019s customers had no problem pulling out their phones and showing him the text messages they had sent to others about YourGrocer, as well as any Facebook posts they had made about shopping with it. In those messages, Morgan saw customers express what they felt was valuable about YourGrocer. He learned that the messages they sent to other people were about getting groceries from a store: We knew that customers wanted quality foods. But just saying we offered quality wasn\u2019t enough. We learned that customers trusted our message of quality only because of the local stores we featured on our site and advertisements. Other messages didn\u2019t stick with them\u2014being good for the environment, our competitive pricing, the ease of use when compared to other delivery services. All that kind of stuff wasn\u2019t really standing out to our customers. It turned out, they were buying from us because they recognized the stores that we featured on our website. This is when the YourGrocer team honed their advertising message. It combined convenience, variety, and quality into one statement: \u201cOnline grocery shopping and same-day home delivery from the local shops you love.\u201d What anxieties do first-time customers experience? What might prevent customers from using your product? So far, Morgan has learned about how important convenience is to his customers. Just how important this was became even more salient when he talked with customers about the first time they tried to use YourGrocer for delivery. He said, We learned about this one anxiety: a lot of people came to the site and had trouble trying to figure out how YourGrocer would fit into their lives. We kept hearing comments such as, \u201cI just don\u2019t know when my groceries are going to get delivered.\u201d This struck us as odd because we give really flexible delivery options. This anxiety didn\u2019t make sense to Morgan and his team. They offered flexible delivery hours, so why were customers commenting about not knowing when their\n\nCase Study: Morgan and YourGrocer \n 77 \ngroceries would be delivered? The answer lay in customers\u2019 shopping habits and expectations. Morgan said, \u201cIt turns out that customers had this obstacle in their buying path. They decided what groceries to buy only after they\u2019d figure out when they\u2019d get the delivery. We had it reversed: you would pick your groceries first and then decide when to have them delivered.\u201d First-time customers coming to the site already had an idea of how YourGrocer was going to work. They had a habit or expectation of coming to a site, finding out how soon they could get a delivery, and then deciding what to buy. When this expectation was violated, they became frustrated and anxious. At this point, they would abandon trying out YourGrocer.24 To fix this problem, YourGrocer adjusted the checkout process. It asked customers to pick a delivery window first and then walked them through the grocery-selection process. \u201cThat helped,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cWe saw conversions go up after that.\u201d What habits prevent customers from making progress? Can customers\u2019 habits be competition? Anxiety wasn\u2019t the only emotional force the YourGrocer team members would face. They also had to navigate customers\u2019 existing habits. Morgan said, Dealing with customers\u2019 existing habits was definitely a challenge with repeat-purchase customers. They had this habit around being able to duck down to the local store when they ran out of a key ingredient while cooking. Then, while they were at the store, they\u2019d pick up extra groceries. In this case, they wouldn\u2019t need to come back to us for another two weeks. Sometimes they\u2019d fall out of the buying cycle, and we\u2019d lose them as customers. Habits like these are our biggest competition. If Morgan wanted to keep customers coming back, he needed to make sure that customers developed new habits around using YourGrocer. He couldn\u2019t focus on only the outcomes customers were looking for. He had to think holistically about the customers\u2019 JTBD. Customers didn\u2019t just want their groceries delivered; they wanted a solution they could use to make their lives better. So, how did Morgan and his team solve it? They focused on helping customers become more successful at using their product.",

      "text": "Case Study: Morgan and YourGrocer \n 78 \nWe get people to set up regular orders with us. We set up e-mail triggers to help remind them that they might need something. The first one goes out three days after getting your first delivery. We send you an e-mail saying, \u201cHey, do you need a top-up on anything? Here\u2019s a free delivery of any size so that you can top up with us.\u201d Seven days after your last purchase, we e-mail you again and ask, \u201cDo you know how easy it is to repeat last week\u2019s order? You can just click this button and get everything delivered again.\u201d These e-mails are part of YourGrocer\u2019s efforts to help customers become better meal planners. This is important to note because customers aren\u2019t consciously joining YourGrocer to become better meal planners. It wasn\u2019t an outcome that customers were seeking; however, meal planning is what customers have to be able to do if they want to use YourGrocer for their JTBD. What progress are customers trying to make? Morgan and his team came to understand their customers\u2019 JTBD by combining their own intuition with what they learned through customer interviews. An important part of our customers\u2019 Job to be Done is, \u201cGive me a way to provide quality food for my family without the stress of running around.\u201d The phrase \u201cYourGrocer does the running around for me\u201d came up quite a bit during the interviews. Before YourGrocer was available to them, if they wanted to go to these local shops, they had to be willing to deal with running around to these different stores\u2014and deal with the hassle of having their kids in tow. Morgan had the first part of the JTBD: his customers were struggling to get quality groceries without all the stress. Next, it was time for him to understand how customers were expecting their lives to be better when they had the right solution. What would it be like when this Job was Done? YourGrocer helps families get back their Saturday mornings and weekends. With us, they can now buy good food for their family without having to sacrifice their Saturday mornings or weekends visiting all these different stores. That\u2019s the trade-off they were struggling with before. If they wanted quality food for their family, they\u2019d have to give up some family time so they could go shopping. If they didn\u2019t want to give up family time, then they\u2019d have to deal with poor-quality food from the supermarkets.\n\nCase Study: Morgan and YourGrocer \n 79 \nHow can you beat the competition? Eliminate the need for the customer to make a trade-off. YourGrocer wins because it does what every great innovation does\u2014that is, it helps customers break a constraint. Using YourGrocer means no longer choosing between quality food for the family and quality time with the family. Morgan said, Once the convenience trade-off was equalized\u2014YourGrocer makes local shopping just as convenient as using a supermarket\u2014then other trade-offs, such as quality and supporting the community, became the differentiators. That\u2019s what sets us above the supermarkets. That\u2019s the real progress that people are able to make with us. \nWHAT\u2019S THE JTBD? From the data Morgan has given us, I\u2019d say that the struggle for progress is as follows: More about: My family having quality food, taking away the stress from grocery shopping, more family time, convenience. Less about: Grocery shopping online/supermarket /local shop, supporting the local community. Again, any kind of task or activity associated with grocery shopping is just a solution for a JTBD\u2014it\u2019s not part of the JTBD itself. I know people who employ housemaids to keep the household fridge stocked with food and groceries. That entails no shopping at all\u2014you pay someone else to take care of it. For those who can\u2019t afford or don\u2019t like that solution, grocery-delivery service is a nice alternative. The progression of solutions in this case study helps us understand what customers do and don\u2019t value. In the beginning, parents were fine visiting multiple shops. They were willing to trade convenience for food quality. But when their family grew, saving time and reducing stress became more important to them. This is how we know that their desire to evolve, their JTBD, is heavily related to finding a way to solve that stress and to save time. This case study also demonstrates how customer needs or wants change over time and don\u2019t belong to the customer. We may think we\u2019re measuring a need, but we\u2019re really just measuring what a customer does or doesn\u2019t like about a particular solution. We must keep in mind that a \u201cneed\u201d represents an interaction between the customer, their desire for progress, and whatever product they\u2019ve hired for their",

At first, Morgan thought he was making a product for young, urban professionals. This demographic certainly did represent some of his customers; however, it turned out that his most dedicated customers were families. Not only that, they almost always had two or more young children. We can learn from this that demographic thinking can be misleading. It was the customers\u2019 situation\u2014not personal characteristics\u2014that determined why they bought. Sometimes, you do have to collect and use demographic data. They can help you when you buy ads and develop promotional material. If you need to develop an ad for video or print, you\u2019ll have to cast actors and set a scene. That means making concrete decisions on what those people should look like, what they do, and where they are. However, these data shouldn\u2019t be used as a basis for product and marketing decisions. They are corollary data, not causal data. Use demographic data only as a guide or hint to help you find JTBD data. Know the difference between customers who switch because they are unhappy with your solution and those who switch because changing life circumstances prompt a redefinition of progress. In Morgan\u2019s case study, the local food shops may or may not have known why their customers stopped shopping with them. Was it because supermarkets offered more selection? Was it about quality? Was it about price? As it happens, none of these applied. These customers switched because they needed more convenience. Let\u2019s slow down and think about this. Notice something important and subtle here. By only observing customers, these businesses would have deduced that some switched to supermarkets. In response, these shops might have been tempted to change their businesses to be more like supermarkets. A butcher shop might think it should offer a wider selection of foods or lower its prices. Yet these things were not why the shops were losing customers. It was about convenience. Next, imagine that these shops did learn that they were losing customers because of convenience. What should they do about it? This is a turning point where many businesses go terribly wrong. The knee-jerk reaction for many businesses in this position would be to figure out ways to offer more convenience themselves. They might be tempted to develop their own delivery services. This could be risky;\n\nCase Study: Morgan and YourGrocer \n 81 \ndelivery might just add to their costs without a significant return in profit. Instead, the way to win back customers and keep existing customers was to coordinate with YourGrocer\u2014a partner who would deliver groceries on their behalf. They didn\u2019t have to change their product at all. Too often, businesses try to increase revenue by developing new products and features that are beyond their expertise. While they may capture more revenue, the endeavor ends up being a drain on time and money. This results in increased costs, minimal revenue gain, and likely a decrease in profits. Avoid this scenario by understanding why customers are switching away from your product. It could be that you can win back customers with little or no change to your product, as these small grocery stores did. Create better advertising and promotional material by speaking to what customers value. Talk with customers to learn what messages connect with them. Don\u2019t simply show them a bunch of ads and ask what they like. Instead, learn what made them think that one solution was better than another. How did they describe using a product to their friends and family? Morgan learned that just using the word quality didn\u2019t convey quality to customers. He needed to show pictures of the shops where the food came from. The shop logos did convey quality to customers. Teams become more motivated, build consensus, and share a vision when they do Customer Jobs research together. Morgan\u2019s third cofounder, Frankie \u201cPragmatic,\u201d wanted to do JTBD research before joining YourGrocer. He also wanted to do it before he built anything. The benefits of this approach cannot be understated. First, the YourGrocer team immediately built consensus about what kind of product they needed to offer. Second, the team got the design of YourGrocer pretty spot-on the first time. They made a few adjustments along the way but never needed to make any significant pivots to the business model or how the company was going to solve its customers\u2019 JTBD.",

      "text": "83 \n6 THE FORCES OF PROGRESS Forces that oppose each other Unpacking demand generation Push and pull shape the JTBD Unpacking demand reduction Put it to workThe last few case studies made frequent references to pushes, pulls, inertia, and anxieties. These four forces work together to generate and shape customer demand. This singular focus on customer motivation, and how forces shape customer demand, is what distinguishes JTBD from theories of innovation and design processes. This chapter will introduce you to Customer Jobs thinking by unpacking the forces of progress. Understanding these forces will make you better at communicating customer motivation within your organization, understanding why customers are or are not attracted to your product, helping more customers buy your product, and creating advertising that connects with customers. \nFORCES THAT OPPOSE EACH OTHER The forces of progress are the emotional forces that generate and shape customers\u2019 demand for a product. They can be used to describe a high-level demand for any solution for the customers\u2019 JTBD or the demand for a specific product. Two groups of forces work against each other to shape customer demand (figure 10). The first group is push and pull, or the forces that work together to generate demand. The other group is inertia and anxiety, or the forces that work together to reduce demand. In the middle, you have the customer, who experiences all these emotions at once. Customers experience some combination of these forces before they buy a product, as they search for and choose a product, when they use a product, and when they use that product to make their lives better. Most innovators focus on the top two forces. They want to know \u201cwhat customers want\u201d and how demand is generated. They overlook the bottom two forces\u2014that is, the forces that reduce and block that demand.\n\nThe Forces of Progress \n 84 \nThe innovators featured in this book are successful because they think about all four of these forces. Moreover, they think about how the forces contribute to the larger system that includes customers, producers, demand, and products. We\u2019ll study this larger system later in the book. For now, we\u2019ll unpack the four forces and understand how they generate and reduce demand. \nUNPACKING DEMAND GENERATION Demand isn\u2019t spontaneously generated. No one wakes up in the morning and suddenly thinks, Today, I\u2019m going to buy a new car. Some combination of events always comes together to generate that demand. We call those forces push and pull. Push. People won\u2019t change when they are happy with the way things are. Why would they? People change only when circumstances push them to be unhappy with the way things are. These pushes can be external or internal. External pushes. Morgan learned that parents had no problem shopping at multiple food shops with one child. But when they had two or more children to haul around to all these food shops, you can imagine all the stress and effort involved in that (or you may have experienced it yourself). Each child has to be put into and taken out of a car seat, parents need to navigate shops with strollers and shopping carts, and they need to carry all their groceries back to their car with their children in tow. Finally, they have to do all this all over again at the next shop they visit. Having a second child who makes grocery shopping unbearable is an example of a push. These parents have realized that their lives have changed, and the old way of solving their problems needs to change along with that. \nFigure 10. The forces of progress that create and reduce demand.",

      "text": "The Forces of Progress \n 85 \nInternal pushes. The Clarity and Form Theatricals case studies show examples of internal pushes. Clarity\u2019s customers were entrepreneurs who thought they were in a slump and struggled with motivation. Form Theatricals discovered various internal motivations that pushed customers to seek a solution for their struggle. These pushes ranged from frustration with the homogeneity of a peer group to parents who wanted experiences for their children that would teach life lessons. In these examples, the outside world wasn\u2019t forcing customers to change. Rather, they experienced a combination of circumstances that made them think, I don\u2019t like how things are; I want to make a change. Pull. If a push is the engine that powers customer motivation, the pull is the steering wheel that directs motivation. Customers experience two kinds of pulls: (1) an idea of a better life and (2) a preference for a particular product. The pull for a better life. People don\u2019t buy products just to have or use them; they buy products to help make their lives better (i.e., make progress). When they have the right product for their problem, they are able to do things they couldn\u2019t before. The idea of this better life is what pulls them to act. It\u2019s important to be able to answer the question \u201cHow will customers evolve when they have the right solution?\u201d One way of thinking about this type of pull is to see what happens when customers don\u2019t recognize how life can be better (or refuse to act to improve it). For example, Dan described how some entrepreneurs would sit in the dark and choose not to self-educate. It is important to note that these customers are aware of their desire to change but choose to do nothing about it. People choose not to improve their lives for many reasons. Psychologist Gary Klein posits that customers must engage in various mental simulations before they take any kind of action. They need to make sense of their desire to evolve, and they need to create expectations of how life will be better when their struggle is resolved. A customer who fails to do either of those mental simulations will not be motivated to make a change. For example, an entrepreneur who struggles with running her business might simply assume that such a struggle is an unavoidable aspect of entrepreneurship. She thinks, that\u2019s just the way things are. Another entrepreneur might recognize that the struggle is due to his inability to create a proper business model and assume that creating a business model is inherently hard.\n\nThe Forces of Progress \n 86 \nThe pull toward a solution. The pull for self-improvement is what motivates customers to begin searching for and using a solution. But what about their motivation to choose one solution over another? Dan learned that Clarity\u2019s customers thought about and evaluated solutions such as using LinkedIn, giving away adviser shares, and attending a conference. Why choose one over another? There are many known and unknown factors to consider about why customers choose one solution over another. However, when we focus on the forces that generate demand, we see that the context of the customer\u2019s push shapes his or her desire to change. This affects the criteria used to choose one solution over another. For example, attending a conference and using Clarity each compete for the same JTBD; however, one is not universally better than the other. If Clarity was universally better than attending a conference, then no one would attend conferences. The reason that many options coexist is that the pushes that shape a desire for change contain many variations. Someone may want advice from successful entrepreneur Mark Cuban; however, that person may not be in a rush or may not even be sure exactly what his problem is. For these reasons, this person is willing to wait for the next time Mark Cuban speaks at a conference. Conversely, another entrepreneur might urgently need help with a specific problem that she knows Mark Cuban has solved and so is willing to pay a premium to have Cuban talk directly with her. Variations in the pushes that customers experience also explain why the same customer might go back and forth between different products for the same JTBD. Sometimes, Clarity might be better; sometimes, attending a conference might be better. It all depends on the context of the struggle.",

      "text": "The Forces of Progress \n 87 \nPUSH AND PULL SHAPE THE JTBD There is no demand\u2014and therefore no JTBD\u2014unless push and pull work together. A powerful step in understanding customer motivation is to study and appreciate the interdependencies between push and pull. They need each other. I might be attracted to the idea of owning an electric car from Tesla, but I won\u2019t buy one unless I need a car. I have no push. Likewise, unless an electric car comes along that is attractive to me\u2014it generates pull\u2014I will accept that owning a car with an internal combustion engine is \u201cjust the way things are.\u201d Generating demand. Appreciating the interdependency between push and pull is why Elon Musk decided that Tesla\u2019s first electric car would be a premium, high-end model. Musk believed he needed first to persuade customers that an electric car could be attractive, perform well, and be practical. He knew he needed to create pull to begin changing people\u2019s minds. Once he did that, he could begin producing less expensive cars with the manufacturing know-how gained through production experience while maintaining the company with the profits from selling high-margin cars. How\u2019s it working out? In 2016, about thirteen years after the company started, Tesla introduced its first low-end electric car. In the first week, it received an unprecedented 325,000 preorders for a car that customers had neither driven nor seen in person.25 Failing to generate demand. When you fail to appreciate the forces of progress generation and the interdependencies between them, you get an innovation like the Tata Nano. In 2008, Tata Motors believed it could offer a low-end, feature-minimal car that would shake up the automobile market. Various Harvard professors wrote books and case studies about its success, claiming that it was \u201ca runaway best \nFigure 11. A breakdown of the forces that generate demand.\n\nThe Forces of Progress \n 88 \nseller,\u201d a \u201cdisruptive innovation,\u201d and that it \u201cmay disrupt the entire automobile distribution system in India.\u201d26 However, the reality proved quite different. Nano sales have been abysmal. After six years of production, annual sales in 2015 were only 18,531. In the end, Tata spent $400 million developing a flop. The blunder has forced Tata Motors to lay off workers and engage in costly redesigns.27 Why did the Nano fail? It didn\u2019t have enough pull. In its cost-cutting frenzy, Tata didn\u2019t offer a stereo and air-conditioning\u2014features that customers expected from a car. Poor design made it roll over easily and prone to fire, and its weak engine made it underpowered for mountain driving. As a result, many customers decided to stick with their motorcycles or to spend the same amount of money on a used car that offered more features.28 As of 2016, Tata has abandoned the idea of finding profit at the low end of the market. Instead, the company is trying to find profit by marching up market with the redesigned Nano GenX. The company is adding more pull to the Nano, so it competes with traditional cars from other manufacturers, such as Smart.29 If your product doesn\u2019t help customers make progress, price doesn\u2019t matter. Both Tesla and Tata understood the push(es) to own a car, but only Tesla appreciated the role pull played. As you\u2019ll learn in a later chapter, it\u2019s na\u00efve to assume that customers will buy a product just because it\u2019s a low-cost, feature-minimal version of an existing product. If that were true, netbooks would have displaced PCs and laptops, and everything inside the dollar store would be stealing away customers from the high-end products they copy. My colleague Ryan D. Hatch once said, \u201cHigh price may actually draw in customers rather than push them away. It implies quality.\u201d He\u2019s absolutely right. Lower price as a differentiator sounds nice in a PowerPoint presentation, in an MBA program, or on a spreadsheet, but innovators know better. They understand that customers value progress above everything else. What good is low price if the product cannot help you get the Job Done?",

      "text": "The Forces of Progress \n 89 \nUNPACKING DEMAND REDUCTION Demand-reduction forces are just as important to understand as demand-generating forces. Most innovators and businesses focus on the latter and ignore the former. They shouldn\u2019t, though. Forces that reduce or block demand should be investigated and managed with the same enthusiasm as demand generation. Why? These forces are just as much competitors as any product produced by a competing business. For example, a struggling customer may be willing to buy your product but doesn\u2019t because he fears that it\u2019s too hard to use. Instead, he sticks to an old way of doing things, even though he\u2019s unhappy with it. In this example, the result for you is the same, regardless of whether the customer stays with the current way of solving problems or buys a competitor\u2019s solution: you miss out on a paying customer. Anxiety. In 2001, a collection of researchers lead by George Loewenstein identified two types of emotions that create anxiety: anticipatory emotions and anticipated emotions. The former are the feelings experienced only at the moment of decision, while the latter are what we expect to feel in the future. Within the context of JTBD and the forces of progress, I respectively call them anxiety-in-choice and anxiety-in-use.30 Anxiety-in-choice. We experience anxiety-in-choice when we don\u2019t know if a product can help us get a Job Done. It exists only when we\u2019ve never used a particular product before. For example, \u201cI\u2019ve never taken the bus to work. Is it ever on time? Where do I buy a ticket?\u201d We do our best to simulate mentally how things will be when we match a particular solution with a JTBD. However, the more \nFigure 12. All the forces, broken down.\n\nThe Forces of Progress \n 90 \nunknowns we face, the more worried we become. Some examples of anxiety-in-choice from our case studies include the following: If I use Clarity, will I sound stupid? Is the call going to be recorded? How is payment handled? This show seems interesting, but it got bad reviews. Maybe it\u2019s not worth getting tickets for. How does YourGrocer work? Are there flexible delivery options? Can I get my order today? These anxiety-induced unknowns are associated with how\u2014or if\u2014a product can deliver progress. These are the anxieties that drive away first-time customers. Anxiety-in-use. After customers use a product for a JTBD, the anxiety-in-choice largely disappears. Now their concerns are related to anxiety-in-use. For example, \u201cI\u2019ve taken the bus to work several times. But sometimes it\u2019s late, and other times it\u2019s early. I wish I knew its arrival time in advance.\u201d In this case, we know a product can deliver progress, but certain qualities about it make us nervous about using it. Dan also discovered anxiety-in-use among his customers. He learned that customers wanted to use Clarity more but were held back because they were not sure how to prep for calls. They know a Clarity call can deliver them progress, but will they be satisfied with the next call? These are the anxieties that drive away repeat customers. Inertia. Just as customers experience different types of anxieties, customers experience different types of inertia. Think of inertia as \u201ca tendency to do nothing or to remain unchanged.\u201d Inertia can manifest in different ways. Mostly, inertia forces are habits: habits-in-choice and habits-in-use. Understanding customers\u2019 habits plays an important part in your ability to offer innovations. Habits-in-choice. These are the forces that exist at the moment of decision and prevent a customer from switching from one product to another. My favorite example of this is how the spreadsheet software Excel finally overtook its competitor, Lotus 1-2-3. In the 1980s, Lotus 1-2-3 was the go-to choice for spreadsheet software. Then, Excel came on the scene. At first, many people wanted to use it. But because they already had all their data stored in Lotus 1-2-3 files, they couldn\u2019t switch. Microsoft solved this problem by giving Excel the ability to import and export Lotus 1-2-3 files. This eliminated the force that was holding customers back from switching to Excel.",

But they quickly discovered a behavioral pattern: customers switched from using YourGrocer regularly to using it irregularly. This transition was an early indicator that a customer was about to fall out of the online-grocery buying cycle and switch back to shopping at the supermarket. What was going on? Morgan learned that these disruptions in buying patterns were the consequences of a habit. Many customers had developed the habit of not planning for future grocery needs. They got it because they had been shopping at supermarkets\u2014that is, their previous solution for their JTBD. Having a supermarket less than five minutes away meant that customers didn\u2019t need to plan their meals very much. They had gotten used to this and so formed a habit. Morgan had discovered an instance where a habit-in-use reduced customer demand for his product. We know that these customers wanted to use YourGrocer because if they hadn\u2019t, they wouldn\u2019t have used it in the first place. However, old habits-in-use were blocking them from continuing to use YourGrocer. Over time, they would regress to using a previous solution. They regressed not because the other solution was better but because customers found that keeping their old habits was easier. If Morgan wanted to keep as many of his customers as possible, he needed to help them drop old habits-in-use and develop new ones. Inertia and anxiety are your silent competitors. At its core, innovation is about helping customers make progress. Get them to that better version of life that they aspire to. It\u2019s not just about helping customers break constraints by pulling them with flashy, new features. A lot of not-so-sexy work is involved. YourGrocer is an example of these forces at work. If Morgan wanted to maintain his customers, he had to help them become better at planning their meals and grocery needs. Samuel Hulick once told me that designing an innovation was similar to conducting an organ transplant. It\u2019s a wonderful analogy. The customer wants your product and hopes it will make life better, but for some reason, the switch doesn\u2019t happen. Customers get hung up on one little thing that blocks them from using your solution for their JTBD. I ferociously attack inertia forces - like habit - as I would any competing product. I recommend you do the same. You can lose revenue because you haven\u2019t accounted for people\u2019s habits, or you can lose revenue because your product is inferior to a competing one. In both cases, the result is the same: you lose revenue.",

      "text": "The Forces of Progress \n 92 \nSolving for customers\u2019 habits is often an easy win. Your prospective customer already knows about your product and wants to buy it but can\u2019t switch because of some small habit holding him or her back. All you have to do is figure out what\u2019s holding your customer back and solve it. \nPUT IT TO WORK First, study the push and pull. The easiest way to begin gathering data about the forces of progress is to identify pushes and pulls. These forces are largely experienced outside any product. You should check off these forces first and then dig into the exploration of any product. Push and pull help you understand how demand is generated and help you set some boundaries when exploring customer motivation. Find pushes by first asking about the solutions that customers have used. At what point did they realize that their particular solution wasn\u2019t working anymore? What was going on in their lives? Find pulls by asking about their opinions about other products they investigated. Why did they choose product X or product Y? What was wrong with product Y? What did X have that Y didn\u2019t? Dig into inertia and anxiety after identifying push and pull. After you understand the forces that generate demand, study the demand-reducing forces. These arise when customer demand meets a product. They can also describe demand reduction for any given product. For example, customers who hire attending a conference experience a different set of demand-reducing forces (i.e., inertia and anxieties) compared with if they choose Clarity. A customer who is shy may choose attending a conference because the idea of talking directly to an expert makes him or her nervous. Fight anxiety and generate pull by helping customers visualize the progress they will make by using your product. Show them how their lives will be better. You could show customers how your company\u2019s outdoor grill is made of the latest and greatest advances in cooking technology. Or you could show customers how great of a cook they will become\u2014and how their family and friends will be impressed\u2014when they use your outdoor grill. Earlier, we introduced the idea that customers engage in various mental processes: they make sense of their current problem, they try to envision how life will be\n\nThe Forces of Progress \n 93 \nbetter when they overcome that problem, and they simulate what it is like to use a product and its effect on their desire to evolve. This process takes a lot of work on the customers\u2019 part.31 Do customers a favor: help them visualize making progress. Create marketing and advertising materials that tell customers that you understand their struggle for progress, that help them visualize how life will be better when they have the right solution, and that explain why your product is the right solution. Reduce anxiety-in-choice with trials, refunds, and discounts. \u201cBuy one, get one free!\u201d \u201cLifetime guarantee!\u201d \u201cFree shipping!\u201d \u201cThirty-day refund!\u201d These are probably the most obvious and widely practiced techniques of managing cost/value expectation. We\u2019re all familiar with them and have heard enough about discounts in Anthony\u2019s case study on theater tickets. We don\u2019t need to go into the subject further. Identify any habits-in-use that keep customers from using your product. Adjust your product to help them along. Morgan learned that after using YourGrocer, many customers reverted to shopping at supermarkets, even though they preferred the food from YourGrocer. How did he help them? You\u2019ll remember that he created automated e-mail notifications encouraging customers to \u201creorder an entire box with one click\u201d and asking, \u201cNeed anything? Get a free refill.\u201d The idea was to help these customers think ahead and make it easier for them to plan meals. Comparing the habits of your best customers with the habits of those who recently quit is a great way to figure out how to turn switchers (i.e., those who have stopped using your product and started using another) into loyal customers. The first group have adapted and developed the necessary skills to get their Jobs Done (change their life-situation). Learn from them and use those data to help customers who are struggling get their Jobs Done.",

The mainframe versus the PC Don\u2019t be fooled by randomness Put it to workThe forces of progress we spoke of earlier can help you understand how demand is generated and reduced. Creative destruction helps you understand the zero-sum nature of competition and how the definition of competition should not be restricted to products that look or function similarly. But what happens when you ignore the forces of progress, creative destruction, and a constancy of purpose to solve a customer\u2019s JTBD? What happens when you insist on selling a particular type of product? What happens when you blindly apply a theory to innovation? This chapter will answer those questions. With this knowledge, you can avoid the costly mistakes that others have made. \nTOO \u201cKOOL\u201d FOR SCHOOL? In 2006, Indian manufacturer Godrej believed it had found a vast, untapped market for household appliances: the hundreds of millions of low-income Indians. Could Godrej create a suitably affordable appliance? Godrej believed that it could succeed in a market that other companies overlooked. But there were unanswered questions: Did an innovation opportunity really exist? What kind of product should the company create? How should it design the product? How would the product be sold? Godrej decided that it needed some help. A Harvard professor\u2019s theory. Godrej hired economist and Harvard Business School professor Dr. Clayton Christensen and his consulting firm, Innosight. At Godrej\u2019s headquarters, Christensen presented some of his innovation theories to its management teams, and they discussed the market opportunity that millions of low-income Indians represented. Christensen agreed that it was a great opportunity, and he suggested that Godrej begin with a low-cost, feature-minimal refrigerator. It\n\nWhen You Define Competition Wrong \n 95 \nwould be\u2014as Christensen calls it\u2014a \u201cdisruptive innovation.\u201d Godrej took Christensen\u2019s advice and hired his consulting firm to aid them in creating what would become the chotuKool.32 About a year later, in 2008, the chotuKool was publicly released to great fanfare. George Menezes, COO of Godrej Appliances, said, \u201cIn three years [we will sell] probably millions.\u201d It even won the Edison Award for Social Impact. Harvard and other business schools wrote case studies praising its innovation success and benefits to society. Dr. Christensen even created a video describing how the chotuKool would create \u201cinclusive growth\u201d that would improve India\u2019s economy and standards of living. Godrej exuberantly planned a platform of similar products, such as the chotuWash washing machine and a low-cost water purifier.33 However, reality was quite different. Using a test market of about 114.2 million people, Godrej had sold fifteen thousand units after two years. The chotuKool was an utter disaster. Godrej quietly abandoned plans for the chotuWash as well as any plans to create further \u201cdisruptive innovations.\u201d34 Redesign, reposition, and relaunch. Recognizing it was a flop, Godrej engaged in a costly redesign of the chotuKool. As of 2016, it\u2019s still being sold, but it\u2019s no longer targeted at low-income Indians. Instead, it\u2019s being advertised to middle-class Indians as a high-end, feature-rich portable cooler. Navroze Godrej, director of \nFigure 13. The original chotuKool was positioned as a \"disruptive innovation\".\n\nWhen You Define Competition Wrong \n 96 \ninnovation and strategy, described the new chotuKool as \u201ca lifestyle product that people use in cars.\u201d G. Sunderraman, a Godrej vice president, commented on the repositioning: \u201cHow can you expect poor consumers with a minimum sustenance to be your pot of gold?\u201d He also said, \u201cWe are now targeting a midlevel buyer.\u201d35 To add insult to injury, this new strategy is directly opposite from the one Godrej had started with. It had wanted a disruptive innovation that offered millions of Indians an inexpensive alternative to the household refrigerator, but the company now makes a luxury alternative to the inexpensive Styrofoam cooler. \nWHY DID THE CHOTUKOOL FLOP? Godrej made numerous mistakes leading up to the chotuKool. We can learn a lot about Customer Jobs and innovation when we compare and contrast its approach to a Customer Jobs approach. Godrej began with a solution instead of a JTBD. The first thing Godrej and Christensen did was to consider which solution to make. Oddly, they came to the decision to create a refrigerator before talking with any potential customers. They jumped to this conclusion because they were following the theory of disruptive innovation, which restricts innovation efforts to a group of specific solutions and \nFigure 14.

      "text": "When You Define Competition Wrong \n 97 \ntechnologies. Godrej and Christensen assumed that consumers wanted a low-cost refrigerator, and that this would make the chotuKool successful. Customer Jobs rejects solution-first approaches and rejects the idea that products of only the same type can be competitors. Customer Jobs argues that you must begin by understanding the customers\u2019 JTBD and how they see competition. Remember the forces of progress: what is pushing and pulling customers to make a change? Don\u2019t assume that customers will buy a particular product just because it\u2019s a cheaper version of another or that they are unhappy with whatever solution they are currently using for a JTBD. Godrej followed its own prejudices and discounted customer motivation. The company did a great deal of research before it designed the chotuKool. Its research team visited people\u2019s homes, observed how they lived, and conducted interviews. Here are some excerpts from them: \u201cI don\u2019t feel the need for a refrigerator. I use an earthen pot to cool water. I buy vegetables for immediate consumption and boil milk to avoid it from getting spoilt.\u201d \u201cIn India, a refrigerator costs around eight thousand to ten thousand rupees. In addition, it has a running expense, which will upset my monthly budget. I don\u2019t have the space to keep it in my tiny house.\u201d \u201cTo me, a refrigerator should cost around twenty-five hundred rupees, and running it should be affordable. How will I service it if needed? My neighbor had to shell out twenty-five hundred rupees for servicing it and an additional three hundred rupees to transport it to a service center. I face load-shedding of six to eight hours every day. How will the product work?\u201d Godrej actually got valuable information about customer motivation, but it seems that it chose to ignore the most important parts. Instead of digging deeper into \u201cI don\u2019t feel the need for a refrigerator,\u201d it focused on \u201ca refrigerator should cost around twenty-five hundred rupees and running it should be affordable.\u201d Why did Godrej do this? Well, it had already decided to create a low-end refrigerator, so it listened to data that confirmed only its prejudices and ignored all the warning signs that consumers had little or no interest in any kind of electric refrigerator.36\n\nWhen You Define Competition Wrong \n 98 \nWhat was the biggest mistake that Christensen and Godrej made? Christensen and Godrej created the chotuKool based on the theory of disruptive innovation. This theory has critical flaws. The biggest? It relies on an oversimplified model of competition that does not take into account how customers see competition. In this case, the theory limits the competition for electric refrigerators to only other electric refrigerators. This is why Christensen and Godrej completely misunderstood the competitive landscape. They did not consider Schumpeter\u2019s warning that competition should not be restricted to products of the same type. Competition can come from anywhere. Customer Jobs invalidates many theories\u2014like disruptive innovation\u2014that try to model and predict the dynamics of a market. Here are a few reasons why: They oversimplify the competitive landscape. JTBD shows us that competition can rarely be restricted to just one type of technology or innovation. Think about all the different types of innovations that compete with Clarity, theater, or YourGrocer. These theories don\u2019t take into consideration that customers often combine multiple products together to form one solution for a JTBD. This is something we\u2019ll see shortly. They don\u2019t take into consideration how customers view competition. People who create these models rarely, if ever, talk with customers and learn how they see competition. A competitive model that doesn\u2019t come from customers will be invalid. The chotuKool is such an example. These theories assume that the competitive landscape won\u2019t change in the future. Competition for a product changes continually. Moreover, often what renders an innovation obsolete isn\u2019t a cheaper or simpler version of itself; rather, it\u2019s when the system around an innovation changes so much that it doesn\u2019t fit anymore. Apple\u2019s iPod wasn\u2019t made obsolete by another type of MP3 player; it was made obsolete by an app on a smartphone. While the fuel injector made the carburetor obsolete, what will make the fuel injector obsolete won\u2019t be a new way of mixing gas and air\u2014it will be electric cars that don\u2019t even use engines or gas!",

      "text": "When You Define Competition Wrong \n 99 \nWhen we acknowledge the complex nature of competition for a JTBD, we can see why rural Indians in Godrej\u2019s target market saw competition to an electric refrigerator as follows: Buying vegetables every day for immediate consumption. Boiling milk to prevent it from spoiling. Keeping water in clay pots at home. Using a more than three-thousand-year-old innovation called a pot-in-pot to keep food and water cold. Using other clay-based cooling innovations, such as the MittiCool. Godrej\u2019s own research had revealed that customers were already hiring these solutions for their JTBD. However, because Godrej had a bias to follow the theory of disruptive innovation, the company chose to ignore these data. Godrej believed in an idea called \u201cnonconsumption\u201d or \u201cnonusers.\u201d Navroze Godrej describes how \u201cClayton and the Innosight team were insistent on focusing on nonusers.\u201d In other words, the company was led to believe these Indians lacked the money or skill to buy and use any product for their JTBD. That\u2019s what Christensen and his team meant by \u201cnonusers\u201d or that \u201cnonconsumption\u201d was taking place. What do you think? Would you consider these Indians as nonconsumers or nonusers? Unfortunately for Godrej, the company learned the answer to this question the hard way: these Indians were consumers, but they just weren\u2019t consumers of electric refrigerators.37 JTBD rejects the idea of nonusers or nonconsumption. Just because consumers aren\u2019t using your product, or another product of the same type, doesn\u2019t mean they are nonusers. This is another big difference between JTBD and other approaches to markets and innovation. JTBD insists that if consumers have a JTBD, they must be using something for it. Here\u2019s the twist: That \u201csomething\u201d that consumers use for their JTBD doesn\u2019t include products that one can only buy. It includes any compensatory behavior, paying someone else for help, making one\u2019s own solution, or combining solutions. Each counts as a solution for a JTBD.\n\nWhen You Define Competition Wrong \n 100 \nWe actually heard about this in Godrej\u2019s own research. One interviewee claimed that she would \u201cbuy vegetables for immediate consumption and boil milk to avoid it from getting spoilt.\u201d Combined, those two actions count as a solution for a JTBD. In the customer\u2019s mind, they are competition to the chotuKool. If Godrej wanted consumers to buy a chotuKool, Godrej needed to offer its target buyers a solution that would persuade them to give up the solutions they were currently hiring for their JTBD. Sadly, the people leading this project didn\u2019t think about that. Godrej didn\u2019t understand that the chotuKool had little to no profit potential. The company assessed chotuKool\u2019s potential by applying the theory of disruptive innovation. Instead, it should have applied some simple math. If it had, any plans to create the chotuKool would have been immediately abandoned. Unfortunately, it took the failure of the chotuKool for Godrej to realize that it had been a mistake to create any type of \u201clow-end\u201d innovation for low-income consumers. Recall what Godrej vice president G. Sunderraman said: \u201cHow can you expect poor consumers with a minimum sustenance to be your pot of gold?\u201d The chotuKool was never going to make much money targeting low-income Indians. Why? In our discussion of creative destruction and profits, we pointed out that competition is a zero-sum game. Profits have to come from somewhere. Whose profits was the chotuKool going to steal? Its target customers were people who lived on only a few dollars a day. How were they going to afford a sixty-dollar to seventy-dollar chotuKool? This price point would have made sense if consumers were spending that kind of money on comparable solutions. Or perhaps they would consider saving up their money if the chotuKool improved their lives dramatically. Neither of these conditions, however, were remotely true. Again, think about the forces of progress. It would have taken a great deal of push and pull to persuade customers to switch from using a free solution for their JTBD to using one they have to pay for. For these consumers, using a clay pot and buying vegetables daily was a good-enough solution for their JTBD. \nTHE MAINFRAME VERSUS THE PC Innovation is hard and unpredictable. I\u2019ve had my share of innovation mishaps. And admittedly, if I had been in Godrej\u2019s place, I might have made some of the same mistakes. It\u2019s easy to stand on the sidelines and critique what someone else does wrong. But there are two mistakes I sure as heck wouldn\u2019t have made:",

Not making sure a true desire for change was taking place and that customers were willing\u2014and able\u2014to pay for a solution. These are common mistakes when you don\u2019t apply a JTBD view to competition. But they aren\u2019t the only ones. A less common mistake\u2014but just as dangerous\u2014is to believe that products are competitors when they are not. One example of this is the widespread belief that PCs and mainframes are (or were) competitors. Was that ever true? Were or are PCs just a cheaper, simpler version of mainframes? Did the introduction of PCs have any effect on the market for mainframes? Did the PC create a new market or tap into existing ones? Understanding the story behind the PC versus the mainframe will help you learn how to think about competition, become better at identifying real threats to your business, create better messaging that properly speaks to what customers consider as competition, and know how you should and shouldn\u2019t design a solution. Here\u2019s the common narrative about PCs versus mainframes. Mainframe computers are large hardware devices that have been used since the mid-twentieth century for massive calculations. Businesses and universities have used them for tasks such as accounting, payroll, and processing scientific data. Governments have used them for tasks such as processing census, tax, and military data (e.g., predicting the effects of atomic bombs). Companies such as IBM sold to these customers, which were the only ones who could afford mainframes and had the skills to operate them. For many years, mainframes were very profitable. To continue grabbing as much profit as possible, makers produced more complicated machines that therefore sold at ever-increasing margins. Then, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, PCs appeared. They were nowhere nearly as powerful as mainframes, but they did appeal to customers who couldn\u2019t afford a mainframe or didn\u2019t need so much computing power. PCs created a new market by appealing to these less demanding customers. Mainframe manufacturers were happy to give up the low-end market because the margins in it were so small.\n\nWhen You Define Competition Wrong \n 102 \nUnfortunately for the mainframe manufacturers, however, the PC got better and better. Eventually, they were just as good, if not better, than mainframes for doing many computational tasks. As a result, the PC created a huge new market and ultimately eliminated the existing mainframe industry.38 The innovator\u2019s\u2014false\u2014dilemma. That\u2019s certainly an interesting story. Yet it\u2019s totally wrong. Before we apply a JTBD perspective here, let\u2019s consider some numbers. Here\u2019s what Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein Research recently said about IBM: The mainframe is a hugely profitable business for IBM. Only around 4 percent of the firm\u2019s revenues come from mainframe sales. But once additional hardware, storage, software, and all kinds of related services have been factored in, the mainframe accounts for a quarter of IBM\u2019s revenue and nearly half of profits.39 It seems that the mainframe business is alive and kicking. In fact, in 2012, IBM announced the newest addition to its line of mainframe computers: the z12. It cost $1 billion to develop and had a starting price of around $1 million. The plan worked well: today, approximately 96 percent of the world\u2019s top one hundred banks, 92 percent of the twenty-five top US retailers, and nine of ten of the world\u2019s largest insurance companies run IBM\u2019s System z mainframes. In 2013, IBM\u2019s revenue was $99.8 billion. Building on the z12\u2019s success, it launched the z13 in 2015. So, what\u2019s going on? The PC had supposedly disrupted the mainframe business. Let\u2019s put a JTBD lens on this story and see what we can find.40 To make sense of it all, we need to ask again if mainframes and PCs were ever in competition with each other. And if you recall, if we want to get an accurate model of competition for JTBD, we have to understand how customers see competition. So, let\u2019s take a look at who buys PCs and mainframes, what they are used for, and what each replaced. Why mainframes? Mainframes have always provided a level and type of computing power that has appealed only to a few. They were first used for intensive",

For scientific or government computations, the alternative was to hire scores of mathematicians (who were usually women in the first decades of computing; they themselves were referred to as \u201ccomputers\u201d) to do the calculations by hand. For businesses, the alternative to a mainframe was scores of secretaries and clerks who either did payroll and sales data by hand or operated cumbersome, electromechanical calculating machines such as the Friden Electro-Mechanical Calculator.41 Today, many of the same entities use mainframes for tasks similar to those of sixty years ago. In fact, today, they are used in an ever-increasing number of contexts. A mainframe most likely processes ATM transactions at any major bank. Global \nFigure 15. Creative destruction in action.

Are PCs competition for mainframes? Here are the real questions: Did purchases of PCs have any impact on the sales of mainframes? Did mainframe manufacturers miss out on a budding market? Is there any relationship between the two types of computer at all? Today, it is safe to say that there is no competitive relationship between PCs and mainframes. Does anyone ever think, Hmm, do I buy a mainframe, or do I buy a PC? Has a company ever replaced a mainframe with a PC? Of course not. Remember, you can claim that two products are competitors only if you can find a customer who has switched from one to the other. But what about PCs versus mainframes thirty years ago\u2014when PCs first became popular? Well, in 1984, PC Magazine interviewed Dr. Norm Agin of Martin Marietta Data Systems about the company\u2019s recent PC purchases. When asked about PCs replacing mainframes, Agin \u201cscoffs at the notion that putting in PCs reduces the load on the company mainframe.\u201d Agin said, \u201cWe picked IBM PCs for compatibility with [our existing IBM] mainframes\u201d and that employees using a PC represented a switch from \u201chaving a calculator and typewriter on [their] desk.\u201d Agin\u2019s comments begs important questions such as: (1) How can PCs and mainframes be competitors if customers use them together? (2) Are these PCs competing with costly mainframes or cheap calculators and typewriters?43 Agin dismissing the competitive relationship between mainframes and PCs is far from unique. We can get a good idea of how consumers in the 1970s and 1980s saw PCs by turning to YouTube\u2019s nearly endless supply of old PC commercials:44 IBM\u2019s 5100 PC, released in 1977, promises to help real estate investors \u201cmanage all the difficult decisions.\u201d Avionic designers could \u201csave time and money\u201d by calculating flight expenses in the office.

Moreover, these commercials don\u2019t make any mention of the high-throughput, transactional integrity tasks for which mainframes are used. Instead, we see PCs helping individuals and small businesses become more productive. Even I remember my first PC. It didn\u2019t replace a mainframe; it replaced my (less expensive and simpler to use) Atari game system. In the minds of customers, PCs and mainframes have no association whatsoever. What was the PC\u2019s competition? Did PCs create a new market? These old TV commercials also make it perfectly clear that the competition for PCs was\u2014and still is, in some cases\u2014typewriters, word-processing machines, personal assistants, calculators, files and file cabinets, interoffice messaging services, graphic design and layout by hand, accounting services or accounting by hand, game systems (e.g., Atari), and tabletop games (e.g., Dungeons & Dragons). The above alternatives represent solutions whose growth and profits were disrupted by PCs. Think back to our lessons from Schumpeter, competition, and creative destruction. When people began buying and using PCs, what did they stop buying and using? It wasn\u2019t mainframes. They stopped buying and using the various solutions above. In addition, the invention of the PC represented a new market if you define markets only by products that look or function similarly. However, from a JTBD point of view, PCs didn\u2019t create a new market. Rather, PCs simply added an alternative to the existing markets that the solutions above constituted.\n\nWhen You Define Competition Wrong \n 106 \nWas the PC really cheaper and simpler? The other point to notice is that the PC didn\u2019t necessarily represent a cheaper alternative to the solutions it replaced. This invalidates the idea that the PC was any kind of low-end, \u201cdisruptive\u201d product. If you had an accounting firm, you could give one of your accountants a PC, and she would be able to do the work of ten accountants. That is certainly cheaper. However, a PC is neither simpler nor cheaper than a board game, a typewriter, or an Atari game system. What do mainframes compete against today? Fifty years ago, mainframes competed against hiring scores of mathematicians and clerks, but what do mainframes compete against today? Once again, we have to find evidence of a switch if we want to answer that question. Luckily, such an example comes from Johnson & Johnson (J&J)\u2014an American company that makes medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and consumer packaged goods (CPGs). In 2015, J&J shut down its last mainframe. In place of owning mainframes, it switched to using a combination of cloud services from Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp., and NTT Communications Corp. Stuart McGuigan, J&J\u2019s chief information officer, commented about the switch: \u201c[It was not] something I was sure I\u2019d see in my lifetime: A Fortune 100 company with absolutely no mainframe footprint.\u201d Why did they switch? J&J needed more computing power and using cloud services allows J&J to lower its infrastructure costs. In other words, J&J wanted more for less.45 \nFigure 16. Changes in revenue from sales of IBM\u2019s mainframes. Dramatic drops and subsequent peaks in revenue are due to product introductions and customer buying patterns, not from customers switching to a competitor.",

      "text": "When You Define Competition Wrong \n 107 \nWhat are the reasons for the mistaken correlation? So, why have people made this mistaken correlation between mainframes and PCs? I can think of two big reasons. Correlation in physical appearance. If you don\u2019t know anything about mainframes or PCs, you\u2019d be tempted to think the latter is simply a smaller version of the former and that they belong to the same market. Just because they are both computers doesn\u2019t mean they are used for the same Jobs. A misunderstanding of how variation works. Because mainframes are very expensive, customers don\u2019t buy them often. This means mainframes have a sales cycle that can last a decade or more. If you were to focus on sales of mainframes in the middle of their sales cycle, you might think that demand had utterly vanished. People who believe that PCs disrupted mainframe sales are making two common statistical errors. First, they mistake common-cause variation for special-cause variation\u2014something discussed in chapter 19. There was no special decline in mainframe sales in response to the availability of PCs. Rather, mainframes have a very up-and-down sales cycle that is normal for them (figure 16). Second, such people conflate correlation and causation. Just because PC sales were going up at a time when mainframe sales were going down doesn\u2019t mean one caused the other. To this day, IBM continues to make a tremendous amount of money selling both mainframes and supporting services. In 2014, IBM had revenue of $92.8 billion, with $21 billon in operating pretax income. The company has been around for more than one hundred years. It maintains success by continually producing high-margin products for customers who have an insatiable demand for more features and more quality.46 Finally, real competition to mainframes has only recently emerged in the form of cloud computing. From the customers\u2019 point of view, competition for the mainframe isn\u2019t owning any kind of computer but outsourcing everything to someone else. \nDON\u2019T BE FOOLED BY RANDOMNESS You will become a better innovator when you recognize that innovation is hard, there are no recipes for success, and there\u2019s no \u201cone right way\u201d to make products\n\nWhen You Define Competition Wrong \n 108 \nand build businesses. It\u2019s why Steve Blank says, \u201cNo business plan survives first contact with customers.\u201d Why is this so? Because life is full of unknown and unknowable variation. Just because a product or business strategy worked once doesn\u2019t mean it work will again. Unfortunately, that doesn\u2019t stop people from trying to sell you recipes for success. The early twentieth century saw Frederick Winslow Taylor sell \u201cscientific management.\u201d Over the last thirty years, countless consultants and academics\u2014who have never innovated themselves\u2014have presumed to tell innovators about the right and wrong ways to innovate. Examples include In Search of Excellence, Built to Last, Good to Great, and The Innovator\u2019s Dilemma.47 However, history shows that such recipes for innovation and business success fail to live up to their promises. Here are some criticisms of these management and innovation theories, as well as their overall approach to research:48 The Halo Effect by Phil Rosenzweig criticizes such formulas and theories as pseudoscientific and falling victim to what he called the \u201cnine delusions\u201d\u2014for example, picking a successful company and making attributions about its culture, leadership, values without offering any objective, experimental data to support it. Thinking, Fast and Slow by Nobel Prize\u2013winning psychologist Dr. Kahneman explains that we\u2019re drawn to these theories because they are done through entertaining storytelling that is \u201csimple,\u201d \u201cconcrete rather than abstract,\u201d and \u201cfocus on a few striking events\u201d instead of the myriad, smaller events that did or didn\u2019t happen. Bongo-playing, Nobel Prize\u2013winning physicist Richard Feynman gave warning of what he called \u201ccargo cult science\u201d and decried these people as selling \u201cscience that isn\u2019t science.\u201d He pointed out that too often, people who are good storytellers can fool those of us who aren\u2019t experienced in scientific rigor or statistics. However, many of us who do have these skills recognize that these management and innovation gurus fall victim to what is called \u201cselecting the dependent variable.\u201d For example, suppose I have a theory that wearing red shorts causes shark attacks. To \u201cprove\u201d this theory, I research shark attacks that happen where the victim wore red shorts. Every time I find an instance where that happens, I pat myself on the back and tell everyone how smart I am. However, such an approach ignores instances where someone wore red shorts and was not attacked by a shark. Such data",

      "text": "When You Define Competition Wrong \n 109 \nwould invalidate my theory; however, I never find them because I never look for them. Innovation and entrepreneurship is hard, full of self-doubt, and riddles us with anxiety about the future. I know; I\u2019ve been there. Nevertheless, when we do find ourselves struggling, we must do our best to not be taken advantage of by these recipe peddlers and modern-day fortune tellers\u2014no matter how confidently they claim to understand the behavior of markets or where their MBAs come from. If I can\u2019t convince you of the heavy costs these people exact on our economies, perhaps disaster stories such as the chotuKool and the $400-million flop of Tata\u2019s Nano can. Customer Jobs frees us from recipe peddlers. Customer Jobs excites me because it doesn\u2019t try to sell me any plug-in-and-play plan for success. It respects the fact that innovation will always require critical thinking and hard work. That\u2019s what makes its message fundamentally different from what recipe peddlers sell. Customer Jobs doesn\u2019t tell me what kind of innovation I should make or how to build it. Instead, its restricts itself to (1) what customers are struggling with, (2) how they imagine their life being better when they have the right solution, and (3) what they do and don\u2019t value in a solution. Such an approach helps innovators like me find innovation opportunities and to navigate a world that is filled with the unknown and unknowable. I find this knowledge empowering. It\u2019s also why I\u2019ve applied it to my own businesses and products. I believe it will help you become a better innovator as well. \nPUT IT TO WORK This chapter is a cautionary tale of what can happen when the principles of Customer Jobs are ignored or unknown. Here are a few things you can do to help you avoid making the same mistakes. Don\u2019t restrict competition to products with similar functionality or physical characteristics. Don\u2019t assume two products are competitors because they look or function similarly. There are two related mistakes people make about what is and isn\u2019t competition for a product. Thinking that two solutions compete against each other because they share similar characteristics. Even though PCs and mainframes are both computers, they don\u2019t compete in the slightest.\n\nWhen You Define Competition Wrong \n 110 \nRestricting the definition of competition to products with similar characteristics. Godrej and Christensen believed that the only competition for their electric refrigerator was other electric refrigerators. They also believed they were creating a new market of refrigerator alternatives. Unfortunately for Godrej, neither of those opinions was true. Consumers were already using several refrigerator alternatives. Keep your mind open to what counts as competition. I recently talked with a woman who told me about switching from her morning coffee to a kale smoothie with a shot of wheatgrass. Who would\u2019ve thought a cup of coffee and a kale smoothie could be competitors? Every innovator, whether creating a new innovation or improving an existing one, should have a clear idea of how his or her customers see competition. When you\u2019re creating a new innovation, you need to answer the question, \u201cWhat are customers going to stop buying when they start buying our solution?\u201d And if you\u2019re creating a new feature for an existing product, you need to ask, \u201cWhat behaviors or other products is this feature going to replace?\u201d Talk with your customers! Your competitive model can come only from them. Models of competition and markets that don\u2019t come from customers are almost guaranteed to be wrong. Don\u2019t study the relationships among customers, products, and competition just from afar. You must actually talk with the customers who use these products. Ask them what else they\u2019ve tried to get the Job Done. Were there other options they wanted to try but didn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t? Did they combine solutions because no single solution worked well? Through questions like these, you can triangulate what customers do or don\u2019t consider as competition. Confirm that competition exists between products by finding customers who switched. At the time of this writing, PC sales have dropped to historic lows; they\u2019ve been on a decline for quite some time. Some people claim that this drop in PC sales is due to the smartphone. But is that true?49 Remember, correlation does not equal causation. There\u2019s only one sure way to prove a causal link between smartphone sales and PC sales: find people who stopped using their PCs and started using smartphones. Unless you can find evidence of a switch, the suggestion that any competitive relationship exists between the two is pure conjecture. Yes, some people may have entirely stopped using a PC in favor",

      "text": "When You Define Competition Wrong \n 111 \nof a smartphone, but a lot of people own and use both. How would you interpret that? Do you think you\u2019re creating a new market? Think again. For too long, businesses have created, and been encouraged to create, their own definitions of markets\u2014that is, which products do and do not compete against each other. JTBD offers us a way to rethink how we define markets. If you think you\u2019re creating a new market, then you probably haven\u2019t done enough research. Have you explored all the options that customers consider as competition for a JTBD solution? Perhaps customers are solving their problems in ways that don\u2019t require the purchase of a physical product. For example, a lot of people in New York City don\u2019t own a laundry machine. Instead, they drop off their laundry at laundromats for other people to clean and fold. Another consideration is how customers often use a combination of solutions for a JTBD\u2014for example, combining (1) boiling milk to make it last, (2) using a pot-in-pot, and (3) buying highly perishable foods only when they can be eaten right away. If you don\u2019t have a clear picture of what customers are going to give up when they start using your product, either you haven\u2019t done enough research, or no JTBD exists and you\u2019re creating a solution that no one will buy. Know what budget you\u2019re taking away from. When commenting on the chotuKool\u2019s initial failure, Godrej vice president G. Sunderraman said that \u201cpoor consumers with a minimum sustenance\u201d were probably not a \u201cpot of gold.\u201d He was absolutely correct. The chotuKool had been conceived without a clear picture of what budget it was going to take from. Dan Martell avoided this problem because he did acquire a clear picture. He knew that Clarity was taking money away from budgets for attending conferences, paying for LinkedIn, hiring consultants, and giving away advisory shares. Having a clear picture of what budget you\u2019re going take money away from helps you figure out what the revenue potential for an innovation is\u2014if there\u2019s any at all\u2014and how much money to invest in creating and selling an innovation. Continually refresh the competitive landscape with ongoing feedback from customers. What customers count as competition for a JTBD is always changing. Don\u2019t assume that it remains static. Somewhere, unknown to you, your\n\nWhen You Define Competition Wrong \n 112 \ncustomers might have come across a new way of getting the Job Done. This is why you need to interact with your customers continually. Your best bet is to talk with your customers regularly and keep interviewing new ones. Learn the stories behind their purchases. What solutions have they tried? What other solutions did they consider before buying yours? For existing customers, learn if they\u2019ve heard about or tried other solutions. For customers who\u2019ve stopped using your product, ask them why. Have they switched to a new solution, or does the JTBD no longer exist for them? Remember that not every JTBD needs to be solved with a product that customers buy. Perhaps the most common reason that an innovation fails is that no one wants it. A great many innovators and entrepreneurs get excited about solving people\u2019s problems. This is a good thing. The downside is that most consumers are fine with good-enough solutions for a JTBD, and many of those don\u2019t require a purchase. As Des Traynor, cofounder of Intercom, says, \u201cThe popularity of product-first businesses has led to short-sightedness around what\u2019s necessary to create a sustainable business. Some problems persist because they\u2019re quite simply not worth solving.\u201d50 The chotuKool case study offers many perfect examples of customers who had good-enough solutions for a JTBD. Rural Indians might like the idea of a small refrigerator, but they were fine using clay pots and shopping for food every day. The chotuKool was a luxury item that didn\u2019t deliver much more progress than their current solutions.\n\n114 \n PART III THE SYSTEM OF PROGRESS As I\u2019ve noted, a study of a customer\u2019s JTBD is fundamentally a study of a system. We are interested in how the system\u2019s parts work together to help customers make progress. In our next case study, we\u2019ll see how Omer Yariv was able to discover a JTBD and create a product for it by focusing on the energy behind customers\u2019 struggling moments. Justin Jackson\u2019s and Ash Maurya\u2019s case studies will help you understand better what \u201ccustomers want progress\u201d and \u201ca JTBD is part of a system\u201d mean. Finally, we\u2019ll look at the system of progress and how the study of it helps create sustainable businesses that make products that customers will buy.",

      "text": "116 \n8 CASE STUDY: OMER AND TRANSCENDENT ENDEAVORS What\u2019s the JTBD? Put it to workI met Omer Yariv at the Customer Jobs Meetup I run here in New York City. At the time, he was vice president of engineering and product at a start-up called Simplist\u2014its product helps you search for specific people within your social network. I particularly enjoy talking with Omer. We share a background in writing, engineering, and, of course, Customer Jobs. Omer joined Transcendent Endeavors (TE) in 2014 and is senior product manager now. Many of TE\u2019s products are about facilitating communication between nurses, doctors, and patients. Omer is in charge of a new-product initiative for helping hospitals improve patient care. He shared with me how he\u2019s using Customer Jobs principles to create a product from scratch. Omer knew which customers he needed to talk with, how to unpack their desire to evolve, and how to figure out what kind of solution would or wouldn\u2019t help them make progress. How Customer Jobs helped Omer get started. Omer\u2019s first task at TE was to develop a solution to prevent adverse events at hospitals\u2014that is, circumstances in which someone\u2019s condition declines because of something other than what brought him or her in for care. Examples are falls, infections, and bedsores. When he started, Omer didn\u2019t know very much about the health-care industry, but that didn\u2019t concern him much. He was confident that he could create a successful product; all he had to do was find a group of people who were struggling to get a Job Done. Who struggled the most with adverse events? He looked for answers. Who had the most to lose when adverse events happened? Who had the most to gain by preventing them? Who was putting the most energy\u2014the most effort\u2014into finding a solution that helped prevent adverse events? Omer believes that finding this energy is imperative to discovering a JTBD: When I interview potential customers, I look for evidence of a struggle. I\u2019m looking for an energy to tap into. That\u2019s how I know a struggling moment exists and that there\u2019s an opportunity to create\n\nCase Study: Omer and Transcendent Endeavors \n 117 \nsomething. If a group of people is not struggling\u2014if I can\u2019t feel that energy\u2014then there\u2019s probably no opportunity there. How does Customer Jobs help you create a product that people actually want to use? At this point, Omer didn\u2019t have very much to go on. All he knew was that adverse events happen at hospitals and that nobody wants them to happen. He said, Hospitals don\u2019t want adverse events. It costs them money. It costs them time. It costs them reputation. Patients don\u2019t want adverse events. Who wants to get sicker? Nurses don\u2019t want adverse events because they\u2019re there to take care of patients. Nobody in the system wants adverse events to happen. How come they still happen? Where\u2019s the gap there? What\u2019s missing? Omer was wrestling with a tough question. Why do adverse events happen, even though so many people don\u2019t want them to? The fact that so many people were affected by adverse events made it hard to know where to start. Omer knew he couldn\u2019t build a solution for everyone. Not only would it be expensive and difficult, but there was no guarantee that all the people would actually use it. Omer\u2019s experience as an innovator had taught him an important lesson: many products fail simply because no one wants them. Of course, he wanted to make something people would actually use. He narrowed his focus on one group of people who struggled the most (who suffered the greatest consequences at any adverse event) and those who were in a position to prevent adverse events. How do you figure out who struggles the most? Omer needed to find out who had the most emotional motivation to prevent adverse events, for they would most likely use whatever product he created. He began by casting a wide net: I wanted to interview potential users [those who will use it] and potential customers [those who will pay for it]. But I had to find the right ones to interview. I wanted to talk with those who had the most energy\u2014who had the most motivation to solve the problem. So, I started creating surveys for the different people involved in adverse events, such as nurses and medical office managers. Omer asked such employees how long they had worked in the field, how often they saw (and managed) adverse events, and whether they thought adverse events were preventable. He began to see who might be best to interview in more depth:",

      "text": "Case Study: Omer and Transcendent Endeavors \n 118 \nWe learned that we needed to talk with nurses who had a lot of patients\u2014and who had to deal with high turnover of those patients. These two conditions ruled out intensive care units [ICUs] and oncology [cancer treatment]. In ICUs, you have only one or two patients to watch over. There is also a high turnover of those patients. You\u2019re dealing with a limited number of patients, and you\u2019re not in charge of them for very long. In oncology, you might have ten patients, but you work with them over a long period of time. You get to know them. But with nurses involved in med/surg [medical/surgical], there seemed to be an opportunity there. Nurses in medical/surgical face a different challenge compared with other nurses. Medical/surgical nurses watch over at least four or five patients at a time, and these turn over within a few days. It\u2019s a tough situation; patients constantly come and go. Nurses learn about their patients\u2019 conditions and needs and care for them for a few days. But just as nurses get to know patients better, new patients take their place. These working conditions are why nurses in medical/surgical deal with the most adverse events. Omer concluded that medical/surgical nurses desired the most change and would be the most likely to use whatever product his team ended up creating. Omer\u2019s next step was to dive into the struggle this particular group of nurses faced. In interviews, he would ask what the struggle was like. Were the nurses trying to prevent adverse events? If so, how? Discover a customer\u2019s JTBD through an interview by looking for the energy of a desire to evolve. Learn how the customer wants life to be. Omer\u2019s first interviews asked broad questions: Does your hospital talk about adverse events? Are there incentives if the number of adverse events goes up or down? How would you describe your daily life as a nurse? What are your routines? What is it like when adverse events happen on your watch? But grabbing just any old data from interviews can make things worse instead of better. To avoid that, Omer looked for signs that these nurses were struggling to make progress:",

      "text": "Case Study: Omer and Transcendent Endeavors \n 119 \nAll through those questions, I\u2019m always looking for energy. If they describe their struggle using a particular solution, or if they describe having any emotional motivation to make things better, I would know that I needed to dig into it more. I was always looking for energy. Omer kept looking for \u201cenergy\u201d around a desire for change. Was there any change in body language or how the nurses talked while describing dealing with adverse events? Did some express frustration with procedures or products they used that left them feeling powerless? What was giving them the most anxiety and stress? What were the forces of progress (i.e., push, pull, anxiety, and inertia)? Sure enough, Omer\u2019s persistent search for energy paid off: I finally started to get an idea of the struggle they faced as a nurse\u2014and in particular when dealing with adverse events. For example, I had no idea that nurses don\u2019t always get along; they don\u2019t always like one another. The situation the hospital puts them in leads them to feel that they\u2019re alone against everybody. The \u201csituation\u201d Omer refers to is how hospitals decide who is liable when an adverse event happens. Nurses generally suffer any consequences, even when an event is not their fault. For example, if a doctor prescribes the wrong medication and the nurse administers it, the nurse is liable, although he or she was not the source of the problem. Such an adverse event goes on a nurse\u2019s permanent record, and he or she could lose a job, lose a license, or be sued. All this can happen because of someone else\u2019s mistake. If all that stress isn\u2019t enough, there\u2019s the social stigma that nurses can face when an adverse event happens on their watch. Omer said, There\u2019s a very strong feeling of \u2018I don\u2019t want to be that nurse that all the other nurses are talking about.\u2019 That\u2019s another very big motivation to make a change. All these struggles create a lot of energy to change things for the better. It\u2019s a JTBD. You found a struggle for progress. Now what? Learn how customers imagine their lives being better. Omer had found a struggle: nurses were afraid of being held liable for adverse events happening on their watch. But he wanted to learn more. How did these nurses want things to be? What would their lives be like if this struggle were resolved? He said, Even with all this struggle they face, you kind of wonder, why do they want to be a nurse? The answer they gave was always the same: They\u2019re there because they feel like they can make a change. They\n\nCase Study: Omer and Transcendent Endeavors \n 120 \nfeel like they\u2019re helping people. That\u2019s the thing that keeps them going\u2014the feeling that you\u2019re helping someone. These nurses want to help people, and that\u2019s why they became nurses in the first place. This was an important piece of their JTBD puzzle. Armed with these two insights\u2014 (1) the struggle and consequences nurses face regarding adverse events and (2) nurses\u2019 desire to feel as if they are helping other people\u2014Omer now had a pretty good idea of what Job these customers were struggling with and what their lives would be like when it got Done. Omer now needed to learn what these nurses valued in a solution. This would help guide his team in designing one to fit the JTBD. How do you learn what customers want in a solution for a JTBD? Even though Omer had a pretty good idea of these nurses\u2019 JTBD, he didn\u2019t know what they would expect in a solution. A JTBD describes the customer\u2019s problem and only hints at what a solution should be. Omer needed to learn the following: How nurses currently handled adverse events. What solutions they had tried. What they did and didn\u2019t value in each solution. Whether they were expressing compensatory behaviors. Whether they were using a combination of solutions because no single solution was good enough. The answers proved fruitful: The story here is that nurses have a lot of things to remember. They want to get them right. There\u2019s a lot at stake if a mistake is made. Nurses take care of people, they run around, they get interrupted, and then they have to put everything into the documentation later. They currently handle all this in two ways. One is memory. Some of them say, \u201cYeah, I remember.\u201d Other nurses take notes. It can be a little bit on their notes app on their iPhone, or sometimes they just jot down notes on their clipboard and put them in their pockets. But they make notes all the time. They make notes, and then they update the",

It\u2019s an iPhone app that connects to the hospital\u2019s documentation system. The diversity of these solutions\u2014and how the nurses used them differently\u2014gave Omer an idea of what the nurses wanted in a solution. But his biggest breakthrough came when he interviewed one nurse who had created her own solution. One nurse I talked with\u2014she started by taking notes on her hand. She would write everything on her hand with a pen, then she would wash her hands, and the notes would go away. So, then she started writing notes on a pad. But as she wrote down more notes, it became hard to keep track of them all. Then, she came up with her own solution. She created worksheets that used a grid system to track all the beds and patients. She would use that to write what she needs to do. Even more interesting was that the other nurses saw this and liked it. So, she started creating photocopies and giving them to other nurses. That was her evolution of a solution for her Job to be Done. That was great to hear. Learning about other solutions gave him valuable information about what these nurses did and didn\u2019t like in one. First, he learned about critical pain points that made a nurse realize that the way he or she was doing things wasn\u2019t working. Next, he learned about what would attract nurses to one solution versus another. Finally, he learned how nurses innovated on their own. It was time to create a solution. Omer first broke down the key moments that would prompt nurses to reach for a solution for their JTBD. He wrote short stories to encapsulate such struggling moments. For example: When I get my handoff, and I need to remember what I need to do, I want to assign beds and interventions quickly, so I can get back to work and not get bogged down. When I\u2019m done with an emergency and I\u2019ve forgotten what I was last doing, I want to catch up with my scheduled interventions, so I can pick up on what I missed and not worry about skipping any patients. When I finish an intervention, I want to mark it as done quickly so I can make sure I don\u2019t double-administer treatments.\n\nCase Study: Omer and Transcendent Endeavors \n 122 \nOmer described how he got these Job stories and how they helped him innovate: \u201cThese struggling moments came after I interviewed nurses and when I started working on a prototype. I wanted those situations documented so that I could make sure I was focusing on the right thing.\u201d Where\u2019s the project now? At the time of this writing, Omer\u2019s team is still in production. They\u2019ve developed prototypes and are now testing, shooting for a 2016 release date. \nWHAT\u2019S THE JTBD? Omer described some great data about a JTBD these nurses faced. The struggles for progress these nurses faced seemed to be the following: More about: avoiding adverse events, not being the nurse everyone talks about, losing my nursing license, protecting myself from liability, being unfairly blamed, feeling like I\u2019m helping people, pride in my work as a nurse. Less about: protecting the hospital, protecting other nurses. Based on what Omer told us, I would describe the progress, the JTBD, these nurses expressed as follows: Arm me with what I need to manage my interventions, so I can focus on helping my patients. There are a few reasons why I like this: This JTBD can be solved with a change in hospital procedures and processes. Nurses don\u2019t have to be buying their own solutions for it. This demonstrates the idea that competition for a JTBD can come from anywhere. It shows how these \u201cneeds\u201d are not intrinsic to these nurses. Rather, they are a product of the health-care system these nurses interact with. These nurses wouldn\u2019t face this struggle if management had designed better processes in the first place. I get a good sense of what life is like when these nurses\u2019 Job is Done.",

      "text": "Case Study: Omer and Transcendent Endeavors \n 123 \nPUT IT TO WORK Begin by identifying a struggle. Start wide and get progressively narrow. The first thing Omer did in creating a new product from scratch was to identify a struggling moment. He started by casting a wide net as he sent surveys to doctors, nurses, and hospital administrators. As he learned more, he focused more. Eventually, he ended up doing one-on-one interviews with nurses who worked within a particular department (medical/surgical). These were the people who were struggling the most. These were his potential customers. Understanding the struggling moment is a crucial part of JTBD. In a previous chapter, we saw how the creators of the chotuKool didn\u2019t focus on a struggling moment. They also jumped to a solution\u2014perhaps because they believed they understood their struggling customers. Don\u2019t do what they did. Instead, emulate Omer: start with an open mind and resolve to stop discovery only after you uncover a customer\u2019s struggling moment. Find innovation opportunities when customers exhibit compensatory behaviors. Omer discovered a nurse who shifted between various solutions for her JTBD. She moved from writing on her hand to writing notes on a pad, and then she created her own worksheet system. It was so helpful that other nurses had asked her to make copies of it, so they could use it as well. Innovation opportunities exist when customers exhibit compensatory behaviors. The edge cases in which customers use your product might also represent innovation opportunities. Always keep an eye out for customers who use a product in novel ways, combine products into solutions, or create their own solutions for a JTBD. They have all the trade-offs, necessities, struggles, and ways to progress in their minds. Why not take advantage when they choose to express them?\n\n125 \n9 CASE STUDY: JUSTIN AND PRODUCT PEOPLE CLUB What\u2019s the JTBD? Put it to workJustin Jackson is an entrepreneur from Canada. At one time, his Twitter bio simply read: \u201cProfessional burrito maker.\u201d In that case, his ten thousand\u2013plus Twitter followers may have made him the most popular burrito maker ever. Never mind his prowess with a burrito tortilla for now. We want to learn more about his experience as a nonstop innovator. The numerous products he has made over the years include the following: Text Me, Slacker. An app that helps users engage existing customers and acquire new ones through SMS messages. Marketing for Developers. A guidebook for marketing software, apps, and digital products. Jolt. A guide that helps users come up with new marketing tactics. ProductPress. A plug-in that turns a regular WordPress site into a membership site. Product People Club. An online community where innovators and entrepreneurs can share their progress, give one another feedback, and track revenue goals. In fact, Justin enjoys innovation so much that he tirelessly encourages others to innovate as well. At the end of 2015, he created the Maker Challenge\u2014a call for others to join him in creating a hundred new products. I first heard about Justin when I saw his short video about the Jobs for which he hires coffee\u2014you\u2019ll read about that shortly. I contacted Justin to chat about his take on Customer Jobs. How was he using it? Was it helpful to him? Justin told me how he had applied Customer Jobs thinking toward Product People Club and also his book, Marketing for Developers. In this case study, you\u2019ll learn how Justin uncovered a struggling moment that his prospective customers faced, as well as how he created a solution for it to help them make their lives better. You\u2019ll learn how he grew his business\u2014not only by adding",

Justin learned about Customer Jobs from Ryan Singer and Jason Fried, product designer and cofounder, respectively, of the software company Basecamp. He said, \u201cI saw that they were doing a Customer Jobs seminar at their office. I remember thinking, Oh, that\u2019s weird. They haven\u2019t done seminars like that before. That was the first time I heard about Jobs [JTBD].\u201d Although Justin didn\u2019t actually attend the seminar, it did put Customer Jobs on his radar. He said, After that, I began noticing Ryan and Jason tweeting about Customer Jobs. Then, during an interview with Ryan, I heard him say something like, \u201cAt 37signals [the former name of Basecamp], we\u2019ve been thinking more about why people hire our product\u2014or what people are hiring our product to do.\u201d I remember at the time thinking, Man, I\u2019ve never thought about it like that before. Their product, Basecamp, is a great example of Customer Jobs thinking. It\u2019s a project management tool. In place of that, you could hire an assistant to manage all your projects for you. Both could do the same Job. Customer Jobs differentiates emotional from functional. Justin once thought of Customer Jobs as an exploration of functionality\u2014as a lot of people do: \u201cAt first, I was just thinking about Jobs as, literally, utilitarian jobs. For example, I\u2019ve hired people to trim my trees. I\u2019ve hired people to fix my plumbing. I\u2019m hiring this product to manage my schedule. I\u2019m hiring this product to make sure that I don\u2019t miss any more meetings.\u201d The more he continued digging into Customer Jobs, however, the better he understood the emotional aspect of Jobs. Jobs as an emotional desire for self-betterment are something that stuck out to him. This interested him so much that he created that coffee video. \u201cI love that emotional aspect [of JTBD]. When people go to a coffee shop, they aren\u2019t just buying caffeinated liquid. They\u2019re going for all these other reasons.\u201d Some of his own motivations for going to coffee shops include getting out of the office to clear his head, feeling cool and creative hanging out there, experiencing the ritual of drinking coffee made the way he likes it, and feeling as if he\u2019s part of a community. This focus on emotional motivation and struggle helps Justin create successful products. In particular, it helped him create Product People Club.\n\nCase Study: Justin and Product People Club \n 127 \nHow do you find a struggling moment when you don\u2019t even have an idea for a product? The inspiration for Justin to create what would become Product People Club came from a moment of frustration: \u201cI was consulting as a product marketing manager at a software company. Things were moving slowly with the team I was working with. I came home one day and wanted a distraction. I [thought], You know what? I\u2019m going to create a new product.\u201d But at that moment, he neither had a concept nor knew what struggle he wanted to solve. However, he did have a few ideas of where to start looking. For years, he had been active in entrepreneur and innovation communities. He had a successful blog, newsletter, and podcast on the topic of entrepreneurship. His experience of interacting with his community told him that a lot of people were putting a lot of energy into solving a struggle about getting started as an entrepreneur. To begin, Justin simply started observing. I decided to take a closer look at the patterns I had been noticing within my audience. I\u2019ve been blogging, sending newsletters, and podcasting for a while. People would frequently write to me with questions or asking for help and advice. I had all this qualitative information, so I began looking through it. Could I find any reoccurring struggling moments that people were experiencing? Justin was looking for recurring behaviors that signaled that people were struggling and that they were looking for a better way. All the while, he asked himself questions: \u201cWhat do people\u2014unprompted\u2014complain about on Twitter?\u201d; \u201cWhat questions do entrepreneurs and innovators keep asking me over and over again?\u201d; \u201cWhat topics are talked about during Meetups about entrepreneurship?\u201d He said, There were two patterns I noticed. One is that people were lonely. People who are working on products and building apps are usually doing it in their spare time. They\u2019re doing it in their basement, by themselves. The other struggling moment I found was this frustration people had when they were just consuming lots of content. They were listening",

      "text": "Case Study: Justin and Product People Club \n 128 \nto all these great interviews on my podcast, listening to other people who are building and launching their own products, but they weren\u2019t doing anything themselves. Justin was seeing patterns and getting questions seeking advice on two main struggles: (1) loneliness and (2) how to sustain the motivation to finish building a product. The people he was observing were solo entrepreneurs who were passionate about creating something but hit these two barriers. Some were in small towns where they couldn\u2019t talk with anyone else about their struggles. Some exhibited concerns about being seen (or even seeing themselves) as poseurs. These barriers slowed\u2014or stopped\u2014their progress. A lot energy was pent up in these struggles, and something to release it was needed to get them unstuck. Justin said, \u201cThey just, they wanted to just fucking do it. They wanted to go out and build their own thing, but they were getting stuck. That\u2019s where I got the idea for Product People Club.\u201d Justin had found a desire to change. Next, he wanted to test how many people were struggling and how intense this desire was. \nFigure 17. A screenshot from productpeople.com.\n\nCase Study: Justin and Product People Club \n 129 \nHow do you test if an innovation opportunity exists for a struggling moment? Justin believed he had tapped into an emotional struggle. Next, he wanted to come up with a way of measuring it. Was there an opportunity to create a product? As a test, he created a simple product: a chat room, capped at twelve people, that cost ten dollars a month to join. He put up a simple promotional web page that spoke to the frustrations and struggles of solo entrepreneurship and procrastination. The ad copy for the Product People Club stresses these struggling moments (figure 17). Justin\u2019s simple web page had tapped into the two aspects of a JTBD: (1) the emotional motivation to better your life and (2) how life is better when you have a solution for your Job\u2014that is, what it is like when the Job is Done. How did it work? He told me, \u201cI posted the website to Hacker News, an online discussion group. Thirty minutes later, the product sold out. By the end of the week, I had a waiting list of almost four hundred people. It was clear: I had hit a nerve.\u201d How do you dig deeper into a struggling moment? Justin had confirmed that an opportunity existed. Now it was time to figure out how to make Product People Club (PPC) more successful. He began interviewing his customers to learn more about their struggle: \u201cI started asking my customers questions in a very deliberate way. I talked to people about why they joined.\u201d Justin asked customers questions such as the following: How did you first hear about PPC? When did you first think about getting involved with PPC? Did you do any research before joining? What was going on in your life when you signed up? Justin was uncovering specific moments of struggle and getting a better idea of what exactly his customers\u2019 struggle was like. That last question\u2014 \u201cWhat was going on in your life when you signed up?\u201d\u2014is gold. The last customer I interviewed, when I was asking him about what was going on in his life when he signed up, he told me, \u201cWell, I had just quit my job. I had decided I was going to start building products and consulting full time.\u201d He then talked about being alone in his house all day, with no one to talk to. His wife would leave for work, and he felt isolated, which is tough when you\u2019re",

      "text": "Case Study: Justin and Product People Club \n 130 \nworking to start a business. He was also worried and scared about his future. This is how Justin began to unpack the first part of a JTBD: the push\u2014the struggling moment. The desire for progress for these entrepreneurs was \u201cI want help managing the feelings of isolation as I start my business.\u201d Through his interviews, Justin could qualify what it meant to feel isolated. He learned that these entrepreneurs wanted to interact with other people who shared the same struggle. Talking with their spouses or neighbors wasn\u2019t helpful. In fact, talking with someone who couldn\u2019t relate to their struggle could make them feel more isolated. As Justin unpacked their struggle with loneliness, he began to tap into the second part of their JTBD: how life was better when they had a solution for their Job. I learned that, when they joined the club, they would have this feeling of \u201cOh, finally! These are my people! These are people I can talk to about what it is like to have prelaunch stress!\u201d Having the right people to talk with helped eased their anxiety and raised their confidence. It\u2019s that sense of community, friendship, relationship, and human connectedness. Now Justin had two important parts of a JTBD: (1) a struggling moment\u2014help me manage feelings of isolation as I start my business\u2014and (2) how things will be better\u2014I\u2019ll have the confidence to persist in being an entrepreneur. His next step was to learn more about what these customers had already tried. This would give him more information about their struggle. His exploration of why they moved from one solution to another would also help him understand what customers did\u2014and didn\u2019t\u2014value in a solution. Studying past customer solutions tells you about the JTBD. Justin continued gathering data about his customers through observation, interviews, surveys, and customer e-mails. This uncovered solutions his customers had already tried. Some examples of what he discovered as competition to Product People Club included the following: MicroConf. A conference geared toward self-funded start-ups. 30\u00d7500. An online course that guides entrepreneurs from product research through launch.\n\nCase Study: Justin and Product People Club \n 131 \nCommunities formed using an online chat application called Slack. Creating a Meetup or attending one created by someone else. One-on-one coaching from other entrepreneurs. Clarity (which we featured in another case study). Learning about what customers did and didn\u2019t like about the other solutions they had tried helped Justin understand what progress he needed to deliver. In particular, he started to pick up on another struggle taking place: [I also learned that] a lot of people in the community have revenue goals for their business. For example, they would say, \u201cI want to do fifty thousand dollars in iOS sales this year.\u201d As I dug down into those things, I began seeing trends. One was a desire to have independent income. The other solutions they tried don\u2019t help with that goal. I felt that Product People Club could help some customers know how to replace, for example, a hundred thousand dollars in income. Justin\u2019s exploration of other solutions customers had tried gave him ideas on how Product People Club could distinguish itself. This helped him know where to take his product next: What if we help you track that income you\u2019re trying to get to? Maybe you are closer than you think or maybe you\u2019re a lot farther and you should not quit your existing job. Right now, we\u2019re working on a feature that will help people track their goals. That\u2019s one thing I think about: how to help people measure their success as they strive to have completely independent income, only from creating and launching products. Can more exploration of the customers\u2019 struggle to change reveal other innovation opportunities? Justin\u2019s awareness of his customers\u2019 struggle for progress led him to uncover related Jobs and therefore more innovation opportunities. For example, what new struggles do customers face once they overcome loneliness? What happens when they have the motivation and confidence to launch their start-up? Justin has some ideas: In terms of what\u2019s next for Product People Club, I keep thinking about how we can help more people build and launch successful",

They have no idea how to get it out to people. That\u2019s an opportunity for another product that I\u2019m exploring right now. Justin is doing something interesting here; he\u2019s exploring struggles related to the one he started with. He started by developing a product that helps people overcome the isolation of solo entrepreneurship by giving them the support and confidence they need to build their own products. Once his customers have a solution for that problem\u2014once they are able to get that Job Done\u2014they need help launching and promoting their new businesses. Creating a product for related Jobs. Justin knew that his existing Product People Club customers would eventually encounter the struggle of marketing their new products. Could he have something ready for them when the time came? He decided on a combination of instructional and interview videos, a book, worksheets, handbooks, and templates. This combination product is called Marketing for Developers. Justin delivers his customers\u2019 progress. Justin is the most prolific innovator I know. Who else challenges others with, \u201cI\u2019m going to try to make a hundred things this year. Want to join me?\u201d Many factors contribute to his success. I believe that one of them is his ability to tap into people\u2019s JTBD. He can sense a customer\u2019s struggling moment, qualify it, and discover how he or she imagines life will be better once a solution is in hand. I also admire Justin\u2019s skill in understanding the idea of delivering ongoing progress to customers. He looks ahead and anticipates the struggles his customers will face. He thought, After I help customers maintain their motivation to launch their businesses, what will they struggle with next? This is what it is like to think about delivering progress to customers. What is even more impressive is that he understood how not to go about solving this downstream Customer Jobs. When he decided to offer a solution for customers to promote new businesses, he didn\u2019t fall into the trap of simply packing more features into Product People Club. Instead, he created an entirely new product. Why? He knew these solutions each solved a different JTBD. Had he done things the other way, he would have risked losing Product People Club\u2019s focus on the Job it should be used for.\n\nCase Study: Justin and Product People Club \n 133 \nWHAT\u2019S THE JTBD? Here are two quotes from Justin that I find most helpful when trying to understand customers\u2019 JTBD: Having the right people to talk with helped eased their anxiety and raised their confidence. It\u2019s that sense of community, friendship, relationship, and human connectedness. Oh, finally! These are my people! These are people I can talk to about what it is like to have prelaunch stress! Justin describes some good JTBD data: he focuses on these solopreneurs\u2019 struggles, and he describes how things will be better when they have the right solution. And when I take quotes like these and match them with the rest of the data Justin gave us, I see the struggle for progress as follows: More about: loneliness and isolation of solopreneurship, sense of community and human connectedness, keeping your motivation up, not feeling like or being perceived as a poseur, \u201cjust do it,\u201d I\u2019ll have the confidence to persist in being an entrepreneur. Less about: attending a conference, taking a class on entrepreneurship, talking with a mentor. With these data and the success of Justin\u2019s Product People Club, I\u2019d phrase one JTBD as follows: Help me overcome the isolation and stress of solopreneurship, so I can have the motivation to finish my product. \nPUT IT TO WORK Justin\u2019s case study is a brilliant example of discovering an innovation opportunity through sniffing out a struggling moment. Let\u2019s see how it reinforces some other important JTBD lessons. Innovation opportunities are found through looking for specific data. Justin realized he had a treasure trove of data only after he began to investigate innovation opportunities; however, he needed an effective way to filter it. He did",

For instance, why are customers using a product other than intended? Or if customers have never complained about it before now, what\u2019s going on? These are the types of questions that help you find innovation opportunities. Know the difference between a struggling customer and a merely inconvenienced customer. Don\u2019t look for evidence of just a casual struggle; rather, look for people who were putting a lot of energy into finding a solution. In Justin\u2019s case, the community he was tapped into was reaching out to him and one another for help. These people were actively looking for a solution to a problem. Perhaps the biggest challenge for an innovator is knowing how to determine if an innovation opportunity exists. It is critical to know the difference between a struggling customer and one who is merely inconvenienced. Aspiring entrepreneurs and innovators often move too quickly from observing a problem to hypothesizing a solution. Instead, be rigorous and look for true struggle. With the chotuKool, Godrej, Christensen, and Innosight jumped to a solution too quickly. Instead, they should have spent some time investigating if customers were really struggling and how intensely. But it turned out that there wasn\u2019t enough of a struggle for customers to buy a low-end refrigerator. Great advertising comes from speaking to the customers\u2019 struggling moment. The promotional page that Justin created for Product People Club was simple. It didn\u2019t need lots of bells and whistles. All it had to do was to speak to the customers\u2019 struggle and show them how things would be better once they found a solution for it\u2014that is, once they were able to get the Job Done. Justin met these targets so well that he sold out his product in thirty minutes. By the end of the week, he had a waiting list of four hundred people. Digging deep into customer motivation reveals innovation opportunities. Don\u2019t be satisfied with superficial facts about the customers\u2019 struggle. Dig deep until you understand the struggle, its context(s), and how customers hope life will be better when they have a solution for their JTBD. You\u2019ll see as you read on that a better understanding of the context of a struggle helps you understand how to grow your product.\n\nCase Study: Justin and Product People Club \n 135 \nJustin didn\u2019t stop when he believed he had solved a struggle. Even when he had Product People Club up and running, he wanted to learn more about the struggle. As we\u2019ve seen, he did this by asking a number of specific questions, and that helped him develop new features and grow his business through offering additional products. You can deliver progress to your customers\u2019 JTBD by offering a set of products that work together as a system. Perhaps the most powerful JTBD principle is that the study of the customers\u2019 JTBD is the study of a system. We\u2019ll look into that more later, but for now, notice two things that Justin did: (1) he created a product (Marketing for Developers) that customers would buy after using a different product (Product People Club), and (2) he designed Marketing for Developers as a collection of videos, reading material, worksheets, and audio material. Justin\u2019s combination of products works together to deliver customer progress. This is an important distinction of JTBD theory: it avoids the problem of unfocused \u201cSwiss Army knife\u201d products that try to solve too many Jobs.",

As a presentation was about to start, I took a seat near the front of the room. Ash soon sat next to me, and we chatted a bit. I learned a bit about his experience as an engineer and entrepreneur. In 2002, he had started WiredReach\u2014a software product that simplified file sharing over the Internet. Eight years later, he sold it. He began blogging about his experiences starting and running a company, and he came across early writing from lean start-up pioneers. This philosophy suggests that innovations should be designed in small, low-risk steps that are tested along the way. It struck a chord with Ash because a lot of its ideas about innovation matched his own experiences. Inspired, he self-published his first book, Running Lean (later republished by O\u2019Reilly Media). Now he\u2019s building another company: Spark 59. It offers a collection of books and tools for entrepreneurs. In June 2014, on a podcast, I heard him share his thoughts on Customer Jobs and how he had been combining it with lean business principles. I wanted to know more about Ash\u2019s thoughts on Customer Jobs and if he had applied its principles to his most successful product, the Lean Canvas. Ash used Customer Jobs to help him learn about why customers were churning from his product, about how he could deliver customers more value with new products and services, and about the benefits of interviewing customers who use his product in novel ways. What is Ash\u2019s latest product for getting a Job Done? Most recently, Ash has focused on helping entrepreneurs get started on the right track and avoid what he calls the \u201cinnovator\u2019s bias.\u201d He said, It\u2019s when people get hit with an idea and then get carried away with it. They lock themselves up, and they start building the solution. They feel like they need to get it all out. They tend to be perfectionists. They spend a long time building a product, exhausting all their resources\u2014and then end up building something no one wants. Ash is describing a scenario that happens all too often: innovators think they have a brilliant idea for a product, they spend time and money building it, but when they",

Ash said, \u201cBecause [innovation is] such a long and hard process, many people also spend time trying to find the investors, or the stakeholders, that will give them the resources to continue building their product.\u201d Ash helps innovators be more successful by helping them avoid the pitfalls associated with the innovator\u2019s bias. A popular tool he has developed for this Job is the Lean Canvas. It\u2019s a diagram you use instead of writing a long-winded business plan\u2014most of which is speculative anyway. Instead, the Lean Canvas asks innovators to answer a set of important questions about how their businesses will deliver value to customers. They then go on to build the first version of their products. Another problem that the Lean Canvas helps with is building consensus and a shared understanding around the business model for a product or company. But what about other struggles for progress? Has Ash found them all? Can studying atypical customers reveal other innovation opportunities? Even though Ash had known about JTBD for a few years, he had never thought about applying any of its concepts to his own product, the Lean Canvas. This changed when he got an e-mail from Franco, a salmon fisher from Chile, who was having trouble using his site. Ash said, \u201cWe have the Lean Canvas as an online product. Every day, there are lots of people coming to the site and using it. When I read that e-mail from the salmon fisher, my first reaction was, \u2018How the heck did he find us?\u2019\u201d Most of the customers who use the Lean Canvas come from the lean start-up community. Ash knew the product\u2019s audience had been broadening, but a salmon fisher from Chile was a dramatic outlier. This is the moment when Ash thought that a Customer Jobs approach could be helpful to him. Ash set up a call with Franco, asking him to describe what made navigating the Lean Canvas website difficult for him. He was lost. At the time, the website assumed customers knew about the lean start-up community. He didn\u2019t know anything about that. Instead, he told me that he had been at a networking event a few nights before. He was talking about wanting to get a loan from the bank for his business. He thought he had to put together a business plan for the bank. The person he was talking with said, \u201cDon\u2019t bother writing a whole business plan. Instead, go to leancanvas.com and create a one-page version of it.\u201d",

This proved to be a tremendous insight for Ash and his team\u2014but not the way you might think. The value wasn\u2019t so much in that Ash had discovered a new Job; rather, it made him revisit a question that had lingered in the back of his mind: \u201cAre we sure we know why people are coming to our website and trying out the Lean Canvas?\u201d You can gather JTBD data from customers who stop using your product. Ash and his team decided to do a new round of customer interviews to discover what Jobs customers were using the Lean Canvas for. They would talk with those who had recently signed up and those who had canceled their subscriptions. They wanted to know the emotional motivations and expectations of the first group, and the second group\u2019s answers would help the team learn how, or if, the Lean Canvas was failing to make customers\u2019 lives better in the way they expected it to. Ash crafted two e-mails. One was a thank-you to new subscribers, and it also conveyed that Ash\u2019s team wanted to hear more about what they hoped to achieve with the Lean Canvas. The message to those who had canceled offered an Amazon.com gift card in exchange for a conversation about why they had canceled. Though Ash got valuable information from both groups, the most useful was from those who had canceled: One unexpected thing that we learned was that customers weren\u2019t leaving because we were doing a bad job. They were actually leaving because they felt like they had been satisfied. They had created their initial business model. They had, in some cases, invalidated it and moved on. They didn\u2019t really see any other purpose to stick around and continue using the Lean Canvas. It appeared that the Lean Canvas was, in a way, a victim of its own success. Innovators would sign up to use the Lean Canvas, get a lot of value from it, and then move on. But that wasn\u2019t how Ash had envisioned the product. The Lean Canvas had been designed for long-term use, but clearly, many customers saw it as a short-term product. What should Ash and his team do? Should they accept a moderate churn rate for customers? You may discover that your product is being used for very different Jobs.

One group of customers took the Lean Canvas as a starting point and then began integrating it into their own product-development processes, altering the Lean Canvas to connect to things like bug-tracking systems and company documentation. Ash found this particularly interesting. He had designed the Lean Canvas as a tool for entrepreneurs to develop business models for start-ups. Yet these particular customers were using the Lean Canvas to help them design features for an existing product. Ash and his team were at a turning point. Which opportunity would they pursue? Should they address the high churn among the original audience (entrepreneurs)? Or should they extend the Lean Canvas to include customers who were using the Lean Canvas in novel ways? Narrowing what Job(s) your product should be used for has benefits. After some discussion with this team, Ash decided to focus on their core audience: innovators who needed help creating and iterating on a business model. Our audience was already broadening on one end [more entrepreneurs were using the Lean Canvas], and if we went down that path of extending the Lean Canvas in all these ways [supporting corporations], we\u2019d be catering to smaller segments. That is the point where you have to decide where your product starts and stops. For us, we said, \u201cThat\u2019s out of scope. If they want to do those kinds of things, there are many other options.\u201d We\u2019re not going to bloat our software with extra features. Instead, we decided to focus on what we do best. Ash is doing something important here. Instead of trying to grow revenue by serving many different Jobs, he\u2019s choosing to focus on the few Jobs that he and his team can deliver the most value for. Instead of turning the Lean Canvas into a Swiss Army knife\u2014a tool that does a lot of things OK but not any one thing great\u2014he was going to evolve it into a scalpel\u2014a specialized tool that is invaluable for a select group of people. The decision was made. Now it was time to figure out exactly how to grow the business. How does thinking about delivering progress help you discover innovation opportunities? To figure out where to take his business next, Ash asked a simple but powerful question:\n\nCase Study: Ash and Lean Stack \n 141 \nTo help us figure out what path to take, we asked ourselves, \u201cWhat comes after that initial canvas?\u201d Our answer was to develop two additional boards that would be used with the Lean Canvas. We wanted to extend the customer\u2019s story in a way that emphasized more than just capturing your idea for a start-up. It\u2019s really about creating a valid business model through experimentation and research. Once again, Ash is doing something very smart here. His team had a question: \u201cHow can we increase revenue by getting customers to use the Lean Canvas longer (i.e., reduce churn)?\u201d Many innovators in this position would be tempted to make changes to their existing product, usually by adding more features. But Ash didn\u2019t do that. The Lean Canvas was great the way it was. Changing it would waste time and money in overengineering a solution and risk upsetting the habits of existing customers. Instead, he made his original product more valuable to customers\u2014not by changing it but by developing new, complementary products. This is when he developed two more boards: an Experiment Report and a Validation Plan. In this new vision, entrepreneurs would first hypothesize and document their business models using the Lean Canvas. Next, they would formulate a strategy for validating their hypotheses, using Ash\u2019s Validation Plan to structure and document that. Then, they could run experiments that would either validate or invalidate parts of that business model; the results of these experiments would be documented on the Experiment Report. Finally, they would update the Lean Canvas and form new hypotheses as needed. Ash both helped his customers be more successful and kept them using his products longer by extending his business with additional products. Customers stopped seeing the Lean Canvas as an end but rather as an ongoing companion. Shift from selling one product to selling a combination of products that work together as a system. Now that Ash had added complementary products, he decided to rebrand his business. The Lean Canvas became the Lean Stack. This change represented the extended value that Ash\u2019s business now offered. In the beginning, there was the Lean Canvas and the various Jobs that people hired it for, such as the following: Cofounders starting companies use the Lean Canvas\u2019s structured approach to help them overcome doubt and uncertainty.",

      "text": "Case Study: Ash and Lean Stack \n 142 \nEntrepreneurs use it to avoid the mistake of wasting time and money building a product no one wants. Some entrepreneurs, like Franco the salmon fisher, want help \u201cselling\u201d themselves and their businesses as investment opportunities. The Lean Canvas is brilliant at these Jobs. The downside is that not a lot of people experience them, and there is a lot of competition among solutions for these Jobs. This means that the Lean Canvas, by itself, had limited growth potential. But Ash extended his business by serving up a collection of products that work together, as a system, to help customers make progress. This was how he was able to activate much more revenue potential. He said, Going back to the salmon fisher, yes, he will create a canvas, but what if he wants to raise money afterward? We could help him down a particular path. We might actually show him how to pitch the canvas to investors. There could be additional products that tie him together with people who can look at his pitch and maybe help him raise money. We\u2019re even developing features that help entrepreneurs run effective board and adviser meetings. Ash\u2019s switch from the Lean Canvas to the Lean Stack puts him in a better position to help his customers with a larger JTBD: Help me become a better and more successful entrepreneur. What is the future of Lean Stack? Ash continues to help entrepreneurs become successful. He is in the process of releasing his next book, Scaling Lean\u2014a follow-up to Running Lean. He\u2019s also just released his BOOTSTART Manifesto\u2014a rallying call for entrepreneurs, reminding them that there has never been a better time to start one\u2019s own business. For the Lean Stack itself, Ash is looking at more Jobs that entrepreneurs struggle with: We\u2019ve learned about many different struggles that people face: starting projects, big companies sustaining innovation, and even release management. As a result, we\u2019ve discovered many different Jobs. We want to continue to learn more about those Jobs and decide which ones we\u2019d like to help customers accomplish.\n\nCase Study: Ash and Lean Stack \n 143 \nWHAT\u2019S THE JTBD? Ash\u2019s case study doesn\u2019t offer much data about one JTBD. Instead, it offers a lot of data about delivering progress for a higher-level struggle. You become better at seeing the big picture when understanding the high-level progress your customers are struggling to make. In Ash\u2019s case, his customers are struggling to become successful entrepreneurs. Along the way, however, they run into various challenges. A good example comes from the salmon fisher who wanted help persuading bankers that his business was worth investing in. Once he secured financing, he could get back to growing his business. Ash\u2019s case study is also interesting because he understood that his Lean Canvas was great at helping people get their Jobs Done. So, instead of trying to make it better\u2014which would most likely only make it worse\u2014he focused on future products. He chose to offer progress with a collection of products that work together as a system: Tools: Lean Canvas, Validation Plan, Experiment Report. Books: Running Lean, Scaling Lean. Training: Online courses, workshops, boot camps. Each product is serving one or more Jobs to be Done. Collectively, they work together to help people become better entrepreneurs. \nPUT IT TO WORK Ash\u2019s Lean Canvas (now Lean Stack) is a great finale for our case studies on applying Customer Jobs theory. Let\u2019s review some specific lessons. Grow your business, reduce churn, and capture more profits by delivering progress to customers. Nowhere is the Customer Job principle of favoring progress over outcomes and goals clearer than in this case study. Ash began his business by delivering well-defined, static outcomes: better business plans and/or consensus among founders. The Lean Canvas does these tasks beautifully\u2014so well, in fact, that some customers don\u2019t need to use the Lean Canvas for long. In this way, the Lean Canvas was a victim of its own success. Ash fixed his high-churn problem by changing his business from one that delivered a static outcome to one that delivers progress. Instead of solely focusing on helping",

This strategy creates more touch points between his business and his customers\u2019 lives, making it more relevant and valuable to them. When you design a product for a specific outcome, customers leave when the outcome is realized. However, improving a customer\u2019s life never ends. As long as Ash helps customers become better entrepreneurs, he\u2019ll retain them. Avoid overengineering your product; develop complementary products. If you sell a software product, offer different versions of it that tailor to different vectors of progress. Ash made a brilliant move that far too few innovators do: he made the Lean Canvas more valuable to customers not by changing the product but by adding complementary ones. Ash knew that the Lean Canvas was great the way it was, so changing it would neither make it more valuable to customers nor bring any new ones to his business. At best, nothing would improve; at worst, time and money would be lost in development, and the changes would upset existing customers. As I keep pointing out (it\u2019s important), adding features to a product doesn\u2019t mean customers will realize more value from it. Remember when we discussed that a technology and innovation can be pushed only so far and deliver customers a finite amount of progress. This is because customers realize value only when they make progress with your product. Unless you can directly connect a change to your product with how it helps make customers\u2019 lives better, you\u2019re likely overengineering your product and wasting money. Unlock your innovation creativity by asking, \u201cWhat comes after?\u201d This is a question every innovator should ask about his or her innovations. After your customers use your product, then what? Do any new challenges arise when customers successfully incorporate your innovation into their lives? Learning these things from your customers will keep your innovation efforts relevant and profitable.\n\n146 \n11 THE SYSTEM OF PROGRESS Why study systems and the system of progress? The interdependencies between customer demand and the producer The system\u2019s four main parts The forces of progress that power the system of progress The system of progress is continuous Is the system of progress new? Put it to workAs I\u2019ve noted, a customer\u2019s JTBD is part of a system. We call it the system of progress. Customers themselves, the products they buy, and the producers who create the products are all parts of this system. Understanding this is very important. It will help you find out what customers want, why they want changes, the relationship between customer motivation and the solutions they choose, and how demand is generated. \nWHY STUDY SYSTEMS AND THE SYSTEM OF PROGRESS? Systems thinking empowered the managers, designers, and engineers of Japan to create successful products that transformed the country from economic ruin to a global powerhouse. In the 1980s, equivalent teams at Ford Motor Company adopted systems thinking, thereby reviving the company, and created one of the most successful cars of all time: the Ford Taurus. Anyone who views innovation and customer motivation through the lens of systems thinking will gain a better understanding of how great products are created and sold.51 Interdependence defines a system. An important principle of systems is the idea that many, and perhaps all, parts have some degree of connectedness with each other. Something happening over \u201chere\u201d affects something way over \u201cthere.\u201d This connectedness is called interdependence. An example of interdependence is what happened when farmers within the United States began spraying DDT\u2014an insecticide\u2014on their crops. Unknown at the time, DDT would get washed off crops and into rivers, fish would swallow it, birds ate the fish, the chemical caused these birds to lay eggs with weak shells, and weak shells prevented baby birds from hatching. The result was a decline in the populations of bald eagles, peregrine falcons, and brown pelicans.52",

      "text": "The System of Progress \n 147 \nStudying interdependencies is an important part of innovation and JTBD. For example, Dan Martell recognized that Clarity was taking away profits from hotels, restaurants, and airlines. Anthony Francavilla realized that a theater production could increase profits by selectively offering discounts. Morgan Ranieri realized that he could reduce churn not by changing how his grocery-delivery service worked but by helping customers become better meal planners. The system of progress is a way to understand the interdependencies between customers, their JTBD, and the producer. Once innovators understand the interdependencies that exist between the various parts of a system of progress, they can inform the producer\u2014who may also be the innovator\u2014how to create and sell solutions for today\u2019s demand and to predict future demand. You do not help customers make progress by optimizing parts of the system of progress individually. You improve the system by optimizing how those parts work together. For example, a mediocre product that customers know about, can buy, and can use will beat out a perfect product that customers don\u2019t know about, can\u2019t buy, or can\u2019t use. \nINTERDEPENDENCIES BETWEEN CUSTOMERS AND PRODUCERS The two most important interdependencies within the system of progress are between customer demand and the producer. The first thing to notice in this diagram (figure 18) is that the system is split into hemispheres. The two parts in the top hemisphere describe customer demand as a JTBD, whereas the two parts in the bottom describe the producer interacting with that demand. The top parts of the system exist in the mind of the customer, who is the only person who can define their struggle to transform their existing life-situation into a preferred one. Yes, the producer can influence these two parts (as I\u2019ll discuss later in the chapter), but innovators cannot define the JTBD. Innovators may introduce new ways of living to customers, but it doesn\u2019t mean customers will accept them.\n\nThe System of Progress \n 148 \nThe bottom parts of the system describe the interdependencies between the customer and the producer. Yes, customers act when they search for, choose, and use a product, but these actions are possible only when producers can create and meet demand, and helps customers evolve themselves. \nTHE SYSTEM\u2019S FOUR MAIN PARTS The customer imagines a better life-salutation (a new me). It all begins with the idea of a new me. Customers can be attracted to a new me because it offers them an opportunity to get away from something they don\u2019t like, or because it offers them an opportunity to grow in a new way. In terms of the forces of progress, these are respectively the push and pull forces. The JTBD arises when customers realize they don\u2019t have what it takes to make that new me happen on their own. \nFigure 18. The System of Progress.",

      "text": "The System of Progress \n 149 \nYour responsibility as an innovator, advertiser, or marketer is to understand this desire for change. How, when, and why did customers realize that they needed to change? If they are struggling, why today but weren\u2019t last month? Was there a change in what they valued? Was there a change in lifestyle? What was wrong with the solution they had been using up to that point? The customer searches for and chooses a solution. After customers believe there is an opportunity to change, they need to search for and choose a solution for their JTBD. This is where producers\u2014businesses that make and sell products\u2014first make contact with prospective customers. This part of the system is also where the richest data about customers\u2019 JTBD are found. Why? (1) Customers have their idea of a new me at the top of mind, (2) they are working hard to imagine how life will be better when they can find the correct solution, (3) they visualize themselves using various solutions, and (4) they calculate how or if a solution will carry them from how they are today to the better me they want. For innovators, data at this part reveal what customers value in a solution and the priority of their values. For example, are parents willing to accept lower quality food if it makes shopping more convenient? For advertisers and marketers, these data help them know when, where, and how the producer should connect with customers. Then, advertisers and marketers are responsible for helping customers become aware of and choose the product. Your goal regarding this part of the system should be to understand why customers are searching for and buying a solution now instead of a month ago. How did customers find and choose (hire) a solution for their desire to change? What were their hiring criteria? What trade-offs are they willing to make\u2014that is, what are they willing to give up, and what are they not willing to give up? Did they try anything else besides the solution they ended up with? Why didn\u2019t those other solutions work?53 The customer uses a solution to start making progress. Customers have designed a new me in their mind and have chosen a solution. Now it is time to think about how customers use the solution. This is the part where engineers and designers take over from advertisers and marketers and create product(s) for customers to use. They must apply their understanding of the customers\u2019 desire to change (the customer\u2019s Job), what customers value in a solution, and how customers expect to make their lives better\n\nThe System of Progress \n 150 \nonce they incorporate that product into their lives. After a solution is created, the producer should continue to monitor\u2014and possibly improve\u2014that solution by studying how customers use it. Gather data at this stage. How do customers use the solution they\u2019ve chosen (even if it\u2019s a solution created by another producer)? Are they using all of it or just parts of it? Are they using it in ways other than what it was designed for? Do they need to combine it with other solutions to get the effect they want? The customer realizes a new me. Finally, customers realize that new me they\u2019ve imagined all this time\u2014or they don\u2019t. When they do, their Job is Done. If those better lives don\u2019t happen, they continue to struggle. They might be forced to combine your product with others to gain the desired effect, or they might put up with your product until something better comes along. \nFigure 19. The forces of progress increase or decrease how quickly the customer moves through the system.\n\nThe System of Progress \n 151 \nTHE FORCES OF PROGRESS THAT POWER THE SYSTEM OF PROGRESS Another interdependency part to the system of progress consists of the forces of progress that customers experience as they move through the systems they belong to. These forces are the engine that speed up\u2014or slow down\u2014customers as they move through the system of progress. They are represented by the dotted lines in our diagram (figure 19). \n Figure 20. When customers make progress (get a job done), new aspirations are often revealed. \nTHE SYSTEM OF PROGRESS IS CONTINUOUS There\u2019s one last part to mention: how the cycle starts again (figure 20). It deserves special attention.",

      "text": "The System of Progress \n 152 \nCustomers\u2019 ability to continue evolving depends on how successful they were at overcoming previous Jobs. Have you ever used a solution to improve your life, only to realize that you face new aspirations? The following are some examples: You buy your first car and enjoy your newfound independence. But now you want some help planning road trips, choosing car insurance, and finding a mechanic whom you can trust. You buy professional pans and enjoy your increased cooking control. But now you\u2019re curious about new techniques and recipes. You also need to figure out where to store those new pans and how to clean them properly. You\u2019ve finally switched from a film camera and physical photo prints to a smartphone. Now you\u2019re curious about sharing your photos on social networks. And you\u2019re taking so many pictures that you need a better way to store and organize them. As we can see, improvement in one part of life often has effects elsewhere. Often, when customers evolve themselves, even more aspirations arise. The system of progress allows customers to evolve. When we add this idea of an evolving customer who continues to want and make progress, we end up with a helical structure like in figure 21 (imagine that the spiral builds up on itself). The top part of the diagram illustrates how the forces of progress perpetually generate demand. The bottom part represents the interdependencies between producers and customers. Through these interdependencies, customers can make progress. The degree of success that customers make depends on how well the producer meets their demands. The expanding radius of the spiral movement represents the customers making progress. This system demonstrates how one or more solutions can work together, or in sequence, to deliver ongoing progress to customers. The following is an example: A customer aspires to become a successful entrepreneur but struggles to get started. He turns to Product People Club to jump-start motivation.\n\nThe System of Progress \n 153 \nProduct People Club is helpful, but the customer has some doubts about the validity of his business model. He turns to Clarity for some advice from someone whom he respects. The advice obtained through Clarity gives a motivation boost and helps the entrepreneur realize that his business model is questionable. This is when he turns to the Lean Stack, using the Lean Canvas to retool the business model, increase his confidence in the business, and develop a shared vision with a new cofounder. Next, it is time to release the new product. But how can the entrepreneur make sure it\u2019s a successful launch? This is when he turns to Justin Jackson\u2019s Marketing for Developers book. \nFigure 21. Demand is generated as customers make progress.\n\nThe System of Progress \n 154 \nJustin\u2019s book helps this entrepreneur become a better marketer. Now he wants help with improving the company\u2019s product with little waste. This is when he puts to use the Lean Stack\u2019s Validation Plan and Experiment Report. And so on. Our example shows how someone who strives to become a successful entrepreneur evolves because he or she exists within a system that perpetually propels customers forward. New Jobs arise as customers make progress. They will use some combination of different products, so they can continue making progress. The system of progress also illustrates why some customers experience demand differently from others. For example, some entrepreneurs may struggle with motivation but not with marketing newly created solutions. Conversely, an aspiring entrepreneur who fails to create a product because he or she cannot sustain motivation will never face the struggle of how to market it. Another example of an evolving customer comes from BananaDesk founder Tim Zenderman. His product offers a complete front-desk solution (project management system + content management system + more) built for hostels. Over time, he has learned how the progress customers want changes as they move through the system. He told me, \u201cAt a high level, we found that hostels go through four stages of growth. The stages can take six months or five years. If some hostels don\u2019t make progress, they\u2019ll stay only at a certain level.\u201d Tim identified these stages as follows: Survive. This is the initial stage a recently launched hostel finds itself in. Owners need to drive enough guests to survive, and there are many ways (or hires) for resolving this Job. Some owners put posters up in the bus terminal, build a direct marketing strategy, or make alliances with hostels in other cities.

      "text": "The System of Progress \n 155 \nControl:Reservations. Once hostels start receiving reservations and managing the front desk more frequently, new problems arise. In particular, overbooking becomes a problem. This is when owners need basic reservation management. This is also when BananaDesk first starts becoming relevant to them. Control:Finance. Once reservation management is under control, they are able to handle a steady stream of customers. They\u2019re making good money. Owners now face new problems. How much cash is at the front desk? How much money did they make last month? Scale. The business is humming along without much intervention. The owners have good reviews and a good occupancy. But how can they sell better? Revenue management, launching a franchise, or developing a direct marketing strategy (to lower customer acquisition costs) are all good potential hires for this new JTBD (Scale). \nFigure 22. New challenges are revealed as a hostel owner makes progress.\n\nThe System of Progress \n 156 \nIf we were to put these struggles into a system, it could look like figure 22. Tim also told me how the same product might be a bad fit for one stage of progress but then becomes relevant later when the customer does make progress. He told me: At the survive stage, hiring a direct marketing strategy is a bad fit because it takes a lot of time to correctly position a business. Moreover, the benefits from a direct marketing strategy take a long time. The hostel might be out of business before it realizes any gains. However, a direct marketing strategy is a great hire for the scale stage. The owners have the flexibility and time to invest in a longer-term strategy. This is also when improving margins starts to become relevant and is part of that new JTBD\u2014something that wasn\u2019t important during the survive stage. The same is true for promoting their business on hostel booking websites. Such promotions are a good hire for survive, not necessarily for scale. If you look at just the functional need of these two stages, they seem similar: \u201cI need to sell beds.\u201d But in both cases, the context around that \u201cneed\u201d is quite different, and that is what determines the best hires for the Job. \nIS THE SYSTEM OF PROGRESS NEW? As novel as this cycle and helix concept may seem, it\u2019s not. In 1939, Walter A. Shewhart introduced the idea that the production of products should be seen as a system and that the aim is to improve that system continually. In 1951, W. Edwards Deming modified it and coined it the \u201cShewhart cycle\u201d when he taught it to the Japanese. Over the next fifty years, Deming evolved the Shewhart cycle to describe the improvement of any system, from health services to management to innovation. The Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) and Shewhart cycles were the genesis for improvement processes such as the Toyota production system, Lean Manufacturing, Six Sigma, and the Lean Startup (build-measure-learn).54 People mostly remember Deming\u2019s introduction of the PDSA cycle. What is often overlooked is Deming\u2019s introduction of the PDSA cycle as a helix. He wanted to emphasize that the ultimate intent is to improve the system continually with the intent of evolving it.\n\nThe System of Progress \n 157 \nWhat is the difference between Shewhart\u2019s cycle and Deming\u2019s PDSA cycle and the system of progress? Shewhart and Deming studied a system that continually improves product quality through increasing knowledge of the process, materials, labor, and so on. We study a system that continually improves customers\u2019 lives through an increase in knowledge of their desires to evolve themselves, how they find solutions, how they use solutions, and how they make their lives better. \nFigure 23.

Here are some ways to think about applying the system of progress. Grow your business by unlocking new aspirations and offering products for them. Justin Jackson\u2019s and Ash Maurya\u2019s case studies provide examples of innovators recognizing the new aspirations that their customers unlock when they make progress. Justin\u2019s Product People Club helps entrepreneurs overcome the struggle of maintaining their motivation long enough to ship their product. After that, they face a new challenge\u2014promoting their newly released product. This is when Justin\u2019s book, Marketing for Developers, becomes relevant for them. Ash\u2019s Lean Canvas helps entrepreneurs become more successful by giving them a way to create a business model that is flexible and adaptable. After that, they face a new challenge: how to iterate on, validate, and improve the business model. This is when Ash\u2019s Validation Plan and Experiment Report become relevant. Get ahead of your customers. When they make progress, how will their interactions with the system of progress change? What new challenges will they face? Maybe you create a new product that meets the new demand. Maybe you add an extension that helps integrate your product with other innovators\u2019 products. Adding a hole at the end of your pan\u2019s handle does not help customers cook better, but it does help them hang your pan on a rack made by you or someone else. Either way, customers will realize more value in your product. Think of your business as delivering a combination of products that work together to forward the system of progress. Your products are touch points between your business and customers. The iPhone is one of the most successful products of all time, but it didn\u2019t do it alone. Many people don\u2019t realize that the iPhone took off only after the App Store was introduced. The App Store and iPhone are separate products (units of output). But when they operate together, they help propel the customer through the system of progress.55\n\nThe System of Progress \n 159 \nMoreover, as Apple\u2019s hardware sales slowdown\u2014because sales for every product will eventually slow\u2014Apple shifts to offering complementary products that build on the progress that the iPhone has unlocked. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in 2016, \u201cIn the last twelve months our services revenue [revenue from products other than the iPhone] is up almost $4 billion year-on-year to $23.1 billion, and we expect it to be the size of a Fortune 100 company next year.\u201d56 Another example is DeWalt\u2014a company that makes tools such as laser specs, compressors, generators, myriad power tools, and contractor-training products. All these work together as a system to help DeWalt\u2019s contractor customers maintain successful careers. Remember that the system of progress represents the interdependencies between the producer and customer demand. Innovation success comes from studying those interdependencies and understanding how they work together to help customers realize progress. \nFigure 24.

Almost every off-the-shelf innovation or design process focuses on only one or a few parts of the system of progress. That isn\u2019t necessarily a problem, but it does create two risks: (1) innovators and producers are not aware that they are omitting necessary data, and (2) innovators and producers overvalue and overanalyze the data they do have access to. For example, a company that has a customer- or user-centric process tries to fill knowledge gaps with ever-increasing data about customers. Therefore, over time, innovation efforts have created ever-larger reports that contain a great deal of irrelevant data about customers\u2014reports that no one ends up reading. Here\u2019s another example: a company that focuses on goals or desired outcomes tries to fill knowledge gaps by identifying an ever-increasing number of them. Yesterday, the innovator needed to identify a few goals or outcomes; today, the innovator believes it needs to identify dozens or even hundreds. But you don\u2019t need to throw out your current design or innovation process just because it doesn\u2019t fit with the system of progress. Instead, learn to appreciate what data you are or are not missing and what you may be overvaluing. Adjust as needed. You might learn that the data you used to think were important aren\u2019t. Find product opportunities by looking forward and backward on the system of progress. You can also deliver solutions for the system segments before or after any given segment. Most people focus on only one segment; we saw some examples of this in our first batch of case studies. Moving forward a segment is what Justin\u2019s and Ash\u2019s case studies show. They did that when they asked, \u201cWhat comes next?\u201d From my own experience, I\u2019ll give a simple and brief example of moving back a segment. Before I created Aim\u2014my advertising marketplace for real estate brokers and bankers\u2014my cofounder and I had worked on another business. It would have been based on a product for mortgage bankers to process applications. Our initial investigation went very well, but during discovery, we learned of a bigger aspiration that mortgage bankers face: to find people who were looking for loans. Mortgage bankers first have to find those who need loans before they can process an application. In fact, this desire is so great that some bankers spend hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to find people who are looking for loans. Our new information\n\nThe System of Progress \n 161 \nprompted us to change our business model and discontinue developing a solution for processing mortgages. As you know, we then focused on helping brokers remove the time and stress involved in finding leads so they can spend more time closing deals. Here, my cofounder and I did the inverse of what Justin and Ash did. Instead of asking, \u201cWhat comes after?\u201d we asked, \u201cWhat comes before?\u201d It turned out that there was a much greater profit potential in solving for the latter struggle.",

Most realize that you cannot trust them to tell you what your next new product will be. How can people tell you what they want if they haven\u2019t seen it before? If we ask them what they want, we\u2019ll end up doing Swan Lake every year! \u2014Mario D\u2019Amico, senior VP of marketing at Cirque du Soleil An innovator\u2019s responsibility is to study and improve the system. Appreciating the system helps you find innovation opportunities and gives you the right mind-set to understand whether, when, where, and how to improve it. This chapter will give you an understanding of what it is like to innovate for the system as a whole instead of innovating for only one part of it. \nTHE CUSTOMER DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM Spirit Airlines is the fastest-growing, most profitable airline in America. Its 2016 Q1 profit margin was a staggering 21.3 percent. Its net income grew 315 percent between 2011 and 2015. How did it achieve such explosive growth and profit? It combines rock-bottom prices with a terrible customer experience. Since it began, customers have ranked Spirit Airlines as the most-hated airline in the United States. If customers hate it so much, why do they keep buying it?57 Another airline, Ryanair, is similar. Customers also rank it as one of worst airlines in the world. It has even been ranked as the second-worst brand in the world. Nevertheless, its growth and profits are consistently staggering. In 2011, its net profit after taxes was \u20ac374.6 million; in 2015, it was \u20ac866.7 million. Which voice of the customer should we listen to\u2014what customers say, or what customers do? 58\n\nInnovation and the System of Progress \n 163 \nWhen Apple announced the iPhone in 2007, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer famously dismissed it. Here\u2019s how he described the \u201cproblem\u201d with the iPhone: \u201cFive hundred dollars! Fully subsidized! That is the most expensive phone in the world! And it doesn\u2019t appeal to business customers because it doesn\u2019t have a keyboard\u2014which makes it not a very good e-mail machine.\u201d 59 Many criticize Mr. Ballmer as being out of touch with what customers wanted, but they are wrong to do so. At that moment, Mr. Ballmer knew exactly what customers wanted; they valued low cost and a physical keyboard. Mr. Ballmer was doing what he thought innovators were supposed to do: empathize with customers, and then design solutions that serve their needs, wants, goals, and desired outcomes. And what was the result of Mr. Ballmer\u2019s empathy? Since making that comment, Microsoft\u2019s smartphone market share went from 12 percent to less than 1 percent in 2016.60 Then, consider Steve Jobs of Apple, a \u201cmonk without empathy.\u201d He changed the world with three massively successful innovations: the Macintosh, the iPod, and the iPhone. He also revived Apple from near bankruptcy to the most valuable company in the world. What was his opinion of customers? He said, \u201cIt isn\u2019t the consumer\u2019s job to know what they want.\u201d He also said, \u201cA lot of times, people don\u2019t know what they want until you show it to them.\u201d 61 Steve Jobs was notorious for being dismissive of customer input\u2014and he was not the only one. Dr. Deming said, \u201cThe customer is the one who supports us.\u201d But he also said, \u201cThe customer invents nothing. The customer does not contribute to the design of the product. He takes what he gets. Customer expectations? Nonsense.\u201d62 Why would Steve Jobs, Dr. Deming, and Mario D\u2019Amico\u2014some of the most important innovators of our time\u2014make these comments about innovation, customer input, and expectations? What did they understand that people like Steve Ballmer don\u2019t? Customers know only what the system tells them. How does a doctor best serve a patient? When a patient tells a doctor she has a fever and stomachache, does the doctor automatically treat the fever and stomachache separately? Will he offer the patient an Advil for the headache and Pepto-Bismol for the stomachache? How about empathy? Will a doctor know how to help a patient once he imagines what it is like to have a fever and stomachache?",

      "text": "Innovation and the System of Progress \n 164 \nOr does the doctor best serve the patient by understanding that the fever and stomachache are not the patient\u2019s problem but only symptoms of the problem? The doctor studies the body, as a system, and recognizes that the patient\u2019s problem is an intestinal infection. An antibiotic should be administered to kill the bacteria, eliminating the infection. The body will heal, and then the fever and stomachache will go away. Doctors treat patients successfully because they understand that the pains and discomforts that patients express are not the problems; they represent the patients\u2019 interactions with their own bodies. Similarly, the needs, wants, and desired outcomes that customers express do not represent their problem; they represent interactions between the customer and the system of progress. Therefore, customers\u2019 stated preferences are unreliable and why customers\u2019 \u201cneeds\u201d and \u201cwants\u201d keep changing. The customers of Spirit Airlines and Ryanair do not understand why management chooses to offer terrible customer service. They think, every other airline gives me free sodas. Why won\u2019t Spirit Airlines? Customers of 2007 expected a $99 smartphone with a keyboard. They were shocked by and did not understand the idea of a $500 keyboard-less smartphone. But fast-forward ten years, and that same customer accepts a $500 keyboard-less smartphone as \u201cjust the way things are.\u201d If Spirit Airlines empathized with customers\u2019 needs, it might be tempted to increase legroom, add reclining seats, offer free drinks, fly to more convenient airports, or stop charging customers $10 to print their boarding passes. However, such changes would increase costs of production, and Spirit Airlines could no longer offer rock-bottom prices. Likewise, if Apple had listened to customers\u2019 insistence on a cheaper, low-end smartphone, it would have missed the opportunity to create a high-end smartphone that delivered progress in a way customers never imagined. The needs, wants, and desired outcomes that customers express will change when the system changes. And there are countless ways a system can change. Keep in mind the dynamic of interdependence: a change over here can affect something way over there. When you study customers\u2019 stated preferences\u2014wants, needs, or desired outcomes\u2014you are studying the interactions between customers and the system only at that moment. All those wants, needs, and desired outcomes will change when the systems that customers belong to change. Yesterday, customers wanted gaslight mantles that wouldn\u2019t set their houses on fire, cheap meat, and somewhere to get their film developed. Today, those same customers want environmentally\n\nInnovation and the System of Progress \n 165 \nfriendly compact fluorescent lightbulbs, organic kale salads, and accumulating likes on Instagram. Why did those needs change? The systems that customers belong to had changed.63 These complex and ever-changing interdependencies within systems are why Steve Jobs said, \u201cIt isn\u2019t the consumer\u2019s job to know what they want.\u201d It\u2019s what Deming meant when he said, \u201cAll customer expectations are only what you and your competitor have led him to expect.\u201d64 Innovators must understand what the customer does and doesn\u2019t know. We must abandon the idea that customers have a laundry list of \u201cneeds.\u201d Instead, we should see customers as having only one need: to make progress within the systems they belong to. Any discomfort or frustrations they experience in making that progress should not be thought of as needs but rather descriptions of interactions between customers, their JTBD, and the product they\u2019ve currently hired for their JTBD. For example, a car owner might claim that he \u201cneeds\u201d more parking options in New York City. But is that really the problem? Or is the problem an expectation that it\u2019s a good idea to own and drive a car in a population-dense area like New York City? Perhaps the best way to help this person make progress isn\u2019t to solve the \u201cneeds\u201d associated with owning a car; rather, it\u2019s to make car ownership obsolete. At the time of this writing, this is the progress that products such as Uber and Lyft are trying to make happen. Customers can tell you of their struggles, how they expect life to be better, and how they interact with the products they use. But they cannot tell you what to do about it. This isn\u2019t because customers aren\u2019t smart enough. It\u2019s because they don\u2019t have access to the appropriate knowledge and theory. Customers do not understand marketing, design, sales, engineering, costs of production, systems thinking, psychology, and statistics all at once. They cannot anticipate all the ways in which their lives will change when they overcome one group of struggles and then face another. They do not understand the system of progress or why they can or cannot move through it.",

This is something the customer does not understand, but you must. \nIMPROVING INTERDEPENDENCIES WITHIN THE SYSTEM It is the innovator\u2019s responsibility to study and understand the interdependencies within the system of progress. The system should be studied as a whole, and improvements to the parts should be done with the intent of making the whole better. Far too often, innovators believe that they can improve the system by studying one part\u2014for example, the customer\u2019s stated preferences\u2014and then making a corollary change to the product. Unfortunately, they often end up only increasing costs of production with no improvement of the system. The result is diminished profits. I\u2019ll give you some brief examples of innovators who increased profits not by studying customers\u2019 stated preferences but by improving how the product interacted with the system it belonged to. Joanna Wiebe: increase profits with new copywriting. Beachway Therapy Center offers a product that helps people overcome addiction. The center knows its customers\u2019 JTBD, and it has a great product for it. However, it was not happy with its sales. What could be done? Joanna made several copywriting changes. One \nFigure 25. Joanna increased revenue by helping customers find and choose a solution for a JTBD.\n\nInnovation and the System of Progress \n 167 \nwas a new headline for the company website: \u201cIf you think you need rehab, you do.\u201d Another was changing the call-to-action button from \u201cSign up today\u201d to \u201cDoes my insurance cover this?\u201d The result was 26 percent more leads, each valued at $20,000 per month.65 Joanna improved the interaction between Beachway\u2019s clinic and the system of progress by creating a promotional copy that helped customers recognize that the clinic\u2019s product represented an appropriate solution for their JTBD. The new headline spoke directly to a lingering question that many people with addiction struggle with. The new call-to-action button was directly aimed at reducing customers\u2019 anxieties. Me: helping new customers use a product. For a long time, FDT\u2014a software program for engineers\u2014had low adoption among some customers. I learned that these customers weren\u2019t accustomed to such a feature-rich, high-end product. What did we do? My team and I didn\u2019t change the core product. Instead, we created a video-training platform and integrated it at various touch points between customers and us. This was meant to help reduce the anxiety and inertia forces that blocked customers from switching to the product. Sales increased. Even though no customers asked for this video platform, they instantly loved it. In this case, we improved our product\u2019s interaction with the system of progress by minimizing the demand-reducing forces\u2014that is, anxiety and inertia\u2014that some customers faced when first using the product. This was done without changing the core product at all; rather, we created additional products\u2014a training platform\u2014that would help customers move through the system of progress. Bob Moesta: increase profits by designing for the system, not for customers\u2019 stated preferences. Bob led marketing and sales at a business that designed, built, and sold homes. The business wanted to offer a home that would appeal to empty nesters\u2014parents who wanted to downsize their home after their children had grown and moved away. Two stated preferences from prospective customers were (1) a smaller dining room because they no longer had big family meals and (2) an expanded second bedroom so their children could visit. Bob\u2019s company delivered on what customers wanted. The result? Tepid sales. Bob figured out the problem. These empty nesters were willing to change almost everything to accommodate living in a smaller home\u2014except for getting rid of their existing, family-size dining room table. It had tremendous sentimental value because it reminded them of countless family meals. When it came to get rid of it so that",

To fix this, Bob did the opposite of what his customers claimed they wanted: he shrunk the second bedroom and expanded the dining room so that it could accommodate their existing family-size dining room table. Moreover, Bob added a big, old-looking dining room table to the demonstration home, for it would help customers visualize themselves living in this unit. The result? A 23 percent increase in sales. These empty nesters thought that a small dining room and larger second bedroom would be best for them, but they were wrong. Why? They did not anticipate how hard it would be to give away their dining room table. How could they? Customers cannot see into the future. They cannot know all the ways in which their lives will change as they move through the system of progress. Bob won because he understood that customers\u2019 stated preferences are unreliable, and that customers\u2019 needs will change as they move through the system of progress. Instead, he studied interactions within the system as customers moved through it, and he made a change with the intent of improving the system as a whole instead of focusing on just one part of it. \nWHEN A SYSTEM\u2019S INTERDEPENDENCIES CHANGE All systems change. Some change slowly; others change quickly. How much and how fast the system changes depends on which interdependencies change and how many. A producer might be able to respond to changes within the system by making a small change of its own\u2014for example, adding a new feature to its product. Sometimes, a big change requires the producer to respond with a bigger change, such as creating a brand-new product. Let\u2019s look at these responses in more detail. Adapting an existing product to match a change in the system. For many years, customers used the FDT software I mentioned above to create games that were played on websites. Customers were happy with it because a healthy sync existed between our solution and our customers\u2019 JTBD. The system of progress operated smoothly.\n\nInnovation and the System of Progress \n 169 \nThen, smartphones came along. This affected the system of progress that our customers and our product belonged to. Now customers wanted help with publishing their games on smartphones, but our product couldn\u2019t help them do that. This frustrated them\u2014and us! Our product could not deliver the progress that they now desired. If we didn\u2019t act quickly, a competitor would take advantage of this opportunity and steal our customers. Fortunately, my team was able to adjust our product to meet this change in the system and fit our customers\u2019 JTBD. The system once again operated smoothly. When customers can\u2019t get their preferred solution for a JTBD. You\u2019ll remember that a cofounder and I created Aim in 2013. But our product was relevant to our customers only because of what had happened three years earlier. \nFigure 26.

The real estate broker would find people who wanted mortgages and send them to a mortgage banker whom the broker knew personally. This was how mortgage bankers used to get their leads. But in 2010, US federal law made the traditional relationship between real estate brokers and mortgage bankers illegal. Just like that, the solution that mortgage bankers preferred for their JTBD was gone. That\u2019s why my cofounder and I created our Aim online advertising platform, which was like Google\u2019s AdSense. It allowed real estate brokers to pass leads to mortgage bankers legally. At first, our prospective customers were apprehensive about using our product because it was very different from what they were used to. However, when they were confronted with either engaging in potentially illegal relationships or using previous solutions they didn\u2019t like, we began to win customers over. In this example, a disruption arose in the system of progress, and it prevented customers from making progress. They were sent back to the beginning, had to reevaluate their struggle, and had to begin searching for and choosing a solution for their JTBD. \nFRAGILE INTERDEPENDENCIES AND CASCADE EFFECTS We\u2019ve looked at examples of innovators generating profits not by changing the product based on customers\u2019 stated preferences but by improving the system that the product belonged to. We\u2019ve also seen examples of responding to changes within the system. Now let\u2019s look at two characteristics of systems that make products vulnerable to creative destruction: (1) fragile interdependencies and (2) cascade effects. Understanding these will help you plan and adapt for changes in the system. Space travel makes for fragile interdependencies and cascade effects. The plot for the movie Gravity kicks off when a missile destroys a satellite. The debris from that satellite then destroys other satellites, whose debris goes on to destroy still more satellites. This cascade effect continues, eventually destroying the transportation that the main character had relied on to get home. If the main character is unable to adapt to all the changes, she will die. In this example, the main character has fragile interdependency with the system she is a part of. In addition, a cascade effect dramatically changes her relationship with the system. In fact, the system changes so much, and her vulnerability is so high, that her chances of survival are almost zero.",

      "text": "Innovation and the System of Progress \n 171 \nWhat happens in Gravity can happen to products. A product\u2019s exposure to creative destruction goes up when it has fragile interdependencies with the system it is a part of or when innovators are unable or unwilling to respond to cascade effects within the system. Some fragile interdependencies expose system parts to creative destruction. Every system is unique. Moreover, each system has countless, unique interdependencies. Some interdependencies are robust; some are fragile. For example, if you were to remove a strand of hair from my head, the rest of my body is barely affected. But if you were to remove my arm, heart, or brain, the rest of my body would be severely affected. This idea of interdependencies and fragility also applies to the system of progress. In 2012, I left my job as FDT\u2019s product manager and once again became an entrepreneur; however, my departure wasn\u2019t hasty. Several months earlier, I had recommended to the CEO that the team be downsized and shifted to other products, that FDT be sold as a subscription instead of through major releases, and that advertising costs be eliminated or reduced. When I got the cost of production down as much as I could, I made one more cost-cutting decision: I fired myself. Why did I do that? I understood that no matter what my team did, future demand for our product would diminish, causing a decline in revenue. And my job was to make sure that the product continued to deliver profits despite the decline in revenue. For that to work, costs had to be reduced. How did I know that revenue would decline? I understood that the product had a fragile interdependency that would drag down future demand: it had a tight coupling with a technology called Adobe Flash. Any changes to Adobe Flash also affected our product. When demand for Flash engineers went up, more of our product sold. When demand for Flash engineers went down, we sold less. Therefore, when I saw that the demand for Flash engineers was on an irreversible decline and would eventually extinguish, I knew demand for the product would disappear as well. In other words, a fragile interdependency made our product more vulnerable to creative destruction. Another example of a fragile interdependency is when smartphone makers use the Android operating system. At first, smartphone makers jumped at the idea that they wouldn\u2019t have to create their own operating system; they could just use Android. However, when they did this, they bound their smartphone\u2019s success to Android. This can cause big problems. Just recently (August 9, 2016), a critical flaw was found in the Android operating system, affecting nine-hundred million phones! This",

A cascade effect within a system is when one change in a system causes another change, triggering still others, and so on. A cascade effect contributes to the main character of Gravity being stranded in space. It\u2019s also important to note that the magnitude (and speed) of these effects is often nonlinear. They start out small, but over time, they gain momentum. How Kodak succumbed to creative destruction is an example of how a business was at first unwilling\u2014and then unable\u2014to respond to a cascade effect. Kodak\u2019s decline wasn\u2019t just because of the shift from film to digital cameras; it was also because of all the downstream effects in the system of progress: (1) digital cameras began replacing film cameras for people\u2019s JTBD; (2) customers switched from stand-alone digital cameras to the cameras in smartphones; (3) digital cameras began to affect other solutions for other jobs\u2014for instance, people switched from using physical prints and snail mail to using digital images, e-mail, text messaging, and online social networks; and (4) a decline in the cost of mobile data, matched with changes in online social networks, encouraged many people to switch from sharing images to sharing video. Another example of a significant cascade effect is smartphones. Smartphones didn\u2019t affect only those systems that included phones as a solution; they also affected systems that included gaming devices, navigation devices, fitness trackers, calculators, flashlights, scanners, bar-code scanners, video cameras, alarm clocks, and so on. The introduction of smartphones created a cascade effect that affected how customers made progress across many different systems. At the time of this writing, smartphones are having a tremendous effect across multiple systems of progress in India. Because so many Indians live on only a few dollars a day, they are forced to make trade-offs on the things they buy. Lakshmi Kumari, who earns $100 a month washing kitchenware in rich homes, says, \u201c[I\u2019ve stopped buying hair-conditioner sachets.] It was an added expense. Shampoo works just fine. I can do without conditioner. But I can\u2019t do anything without my phone. I can\u2019t hear songs, I can\u2019t surf the net, and I can\u2019t chat with friends.\u201d Venkatesh Kini, the president of Coca-Cola in India and southwest Asia, says, \u201cWe are competing for the consumer\u2019s wallet not just with beverages and other impulse categories, but also with data services on smartphones.\u201d 67\n\nInnovation and the System of Progress \n 173 \nAdmittedly, cascade effects are not always that dramatic. We saw a small one happen with Clarity. When customers switched from attending a conference to Clarity, downstream products such as airlines, hotels, and restaurants lost customers as well. Yes, the effect on those products is barely noticeable; however, it demonstrates the complexity of systems. A change in a seemingly distant part of the system can affect the whole. Big things have small beginnings. Thinking about the fragile interdependencies within a system helps me become a better innovator. It even helps me as a customer. Should I buy a new speaker system that I plug my smartphone into? What happens when the smartphone manufacturer changes its inputs? Will I have to get an adapter? Cascade effects are impossible to predict. You can predict a first-order effect. For example, when cars appeared, you might have been able to predict that nearly everyone would use one. But could you also have predicted nth-order effects, such as urban sprawl, Walmart, and car collecting? Probably not. In fact, I would have bet you couldn\u2019t. \nJTBD EMPOWERS US TO INNOVATE JTBD empowers us to innovate in a world filled with variation and complexity. It does this not by offering us strategies on what our innovation should or shouldn\u2019t do but through equipping us with language and principles of customer motivation so that we can become better at creating our own strategies for innovation success. The following are some example scenarios: Sometimes, success comes from continual improvement of existing high-margin products that serve the most-demanding customers, such as IBM and the mainframe over the past seventy years. Or maybe you go the other way and create a feature-minimal product that offers rock-bottom prices and a terrible user experience, akin to what Spirit Airlines does. Sometimes, an innovation simultaneously replaces products that cost considerably more and those that cost less. An accounting firm saves a great deal of money when it buys a PC to do the work of five accountants. At the same time, a PC is considerably more expensive than a typewriter or an Atari game system.",

      "text": "Innovation and the System of Progress \n 174 \nSometimes, all it takes is a few tweaks that help customers use a product, such as what I did with FDT. And sometimes the product is fine the way it is, and all that is needed is to help customers find and choose it, such as what Joanna Wiebe did. Perhaps the best thing to do, though, is to develop new products that help customers evolve themselves in ways they might not be aware of yet\u2014such as what Ash Maurya and Justin Jackson did. It all comes down to four points: (1) all customers want to make progress within the systems they belong to; (2) customers, producers, innovators, and products are all parts of a system; (3) understanding the system comes from studying the interdependencies between the parts, not from studying the parts; and (4) each system is complex and one of a kind, so solutions that improve them must also be one of a kind. Let\u2019s go forth and become great at creating and selling products that people will buy. \nPUT IT TO WORK Here are some points that may help you apply systems thinking to JTBD. Persuade customers to reject their current products by changing their JTBD. A great salesperson understands that customer \u201cwants\u201d come from the system, not the customer. So, if you want to change \u201cwhat customers want,\u201d all you have to do is convince them of a Job that is worth getting Done. Imagine you make outdoor grills. You want to persuade customers to upgrade from small grills to larger, more expensive ones. How do you do that? Well, you won\u2019t have much success if you just pepper customers with messages about how great your larger grill is or try to convince them that an existing grill is inferior. Why? These customers are fine with the way things are. A healthy sync exists between their JTBD and the small grill they\u2019ve hired for it. Customers are making the kind of progress they want. However, you will have a shot at selling a larger grill if you can convince customers how rewarding it is to host a large party and grill food for everyone. If customers agree to that idea of progress, they realize that their current grills can\u2019t get them there.\n\nInnovation and the System of Progress \n 175 \nIn that moment, you\u2019ve changed the customers\u2019 JTBD and changed the system of progress they interact with. If they want to restore sync to the system, then they need a new solution. That\u2019s when you pull the curtain back on the larger grill and casually point out that they can cook food for twenty people. Bring focus to which system of progress you\u2019re solving for by splitting up products that deliver different types of progress. For many years, DeWalt made radial arm saws that woodworkers used to customize shapes. In 1960, Black+Decker (B&D), the tool company that invented the portable electric drill, acquired DeWalt. In the early 1990s, B&D decided that its DeWalt division would serve a different system of progress. B&D would continue to focus on giving homeowners the power to do small-scale home maintenance and fabrication work without the need for professionals. B&D\u2019s products include items for lawn care, preselected power-tool kits, and DIY books. Conversely, DeWalt focuses on helping professional construction contractors have successful careers. Its line includes laser specs, compressors, generators, robust drills, and myriad other power tools and contractor-training products. When done correctly, splitting up products\u2014or sometimes companies\u2014to address different systems of progress is a good answer to the question \u201cWhich jobs should our product or business focus on?\u201d Remember that a product that tries to solve many Jobs at once ends up not being able to solve any one Job well. When this happens, your innovation exposure goes up, and your business becomes vulnerable to creative destruction.",

      "text": "176 \n13 HOW MIGHT WE DESCRIBE A JOB TO BE DONE? Try it yourself Describing a JTBDThe Job to be Done is the big picture. It encapsulates why customers buy your product(s). Here are two ways this big-picture approach helps me: It\u2019s portable throughout an organization. Everyone from marketing to design to engineering can use it. It helps them work together. It\u2019s a good balance between high and low levels. It\u2019s abstract enough to give room for creativity while also offering boundaries where a product starts and stops. This section describes how I like to describe a specific Job to be Done. It\u2019s not the \u201cright\u201d way because I don\u2019t believe there is one \u201cright\u201d way. What\u2019s important are (1) does it help you and your team work together? (2) does it describe a \u201cbetter me\u201d for the customer; and (3) does it help you avoid describing a product or how someone uses it? \nTRY IT YOURSELF If you want to know how I like to phrase a JTBD, jump to the next section. However, I recommend you try to describe one yourself. In this section, I\u2019ll offer you some data I gathered from an investigation I did on why people were buying products from Honest. Honest is a company that sells products ranging from household cleaners to baby supplies. As you read through it, think about how you would describe these customers\u2019 JTBD. The hint I offer you is to think about a JTBD in two parts\u2014where they are today and where they want to be. Honest\u2019s products. Honest offers a wide range of all-natural household and childcare products, including soaps and detergents, moisturizers, sanitizer sprays, cleaners, diapers, baby wipes, baby food, and vitamin supplements, to name just a few. Collectively, they are marketed as giving a family what they need to create a safe, clean, nutritious, toxin-free environment for their children. Besides the products, Honest also offers their products through a by-mail subscription. However, their version is different. The customer chooses\n\nHow Might We Describe A Job to be Done? \n 177 \nsubscriptions to specific product bundles ranging from \u201cdiapers and wipes\u201d to an \u201cessentials\u201d bundle that includes cleaners and bathing products. Understand the customer\u2019s current life-situation. Next, it\u2019s time to focus on the forces of progress that pushed and pulled customers toward buying these products. In this investigation, I found two groups of customers who were struggling the most: (1) parents who had recently had their first child and (2) parents who have children with various environmental sensitivities. Both groups described this struggle: The search for child-safe products left them feeling overwhelmed, tired, and scared. They\u2019d ask for advice from their own parents, friends, doctors, community support groups, and the Internet. To them, it seemed that the more they \u201clearned,\u201d the more confused they would become. Their own parents would say one thing, the doctor would say another, and the Internet\u2026well, the Internet says that everything is both fine and dangerous. Everyone had his or her own opinions. Disagreements and arguments between couples were aplenty. These groups of customers also described similar struggling moments. Here are a few: Are there any chemicals in this baby formula that will harm my child? Is my child getting all the necessary nutrients for healthy brain development? Does my floor cleaner have chemicals in it that will give my baby a rash? This cleaner looks like it\u2019s OK, but it doesn\u2019t specifically say it\u2019s safe for babies. I finally found a safe household cleaner, but what about soap, shampoo, and baby wipes? My baby touches everything and puts everything in his/her mouth. What germs and chemicals do I need to worry about? I see hives and redness on my child. Is the sunscreen not working, or is this an allergic reaction? My information sources all give different answers. Discovering how life should be. As I talked with parents who were struggling, I also asked them how they imagined life being better once they did find the right solution. The data were consistent and generally fell into two categories.",

      "text": "How Might We Describe A Job to be Done? \n 178 \nSome parents felt as if the joy of parenthood were being taken away or reduced. They imagined that if they found the right solution for their struggle, they would have the energy to enjoy being parents and experience the picture of parenthood they had had in their minds when they first decided to have children. Parents felt they would get along better with their spouses. Some couples argued over which products were safe and which issues mattered. Did they need special soaps and shampoos? Wasn\u2019t it good enough that their multipurpose household cleaner was labeled \u201corganic\u201d? Preventing disagreements like these would enable parents to enjoy parenting together instead of them working against each other. What was fired? The last piece of the puzzle is to learn what customers stopped doing when they started using Honest products. The results were consistent. These parents were combining multiple solutions together: Competing brands ranged from Huggies to Earth\u2019s Best to Seventh Generation. If they could, they bought multiple products from one manufacturer. They were asking advice and input from family, friends, doctors, parent communities, and the Internet. Based on these data, how would you describe this JTBD? Do you think there are more than one JTBD? \nDESCRIBING A JTBD Here is how I described one JTBD that I discovered: Free me from the stress I deal with when figuring out what products won\u2019t harm my children, so I can have more time to enjoy being a parent.\n\nHow Might We Describe A Job to be Done? \n 179 \nWhen I put people\u2019s JTBD into words, I prefer to keep it simple. I create a statement that combines the forces that generate demand (push and pull) with the Job and when it\u2019s Done. In this Honest example, you can see two parts: (1) free me from the stress I deal with when figuring out what products won\u2019t harm my children, and (2) so I can have more time to enjoy being a parent. he emphasis on a struggle for progress is why this JTBD model often makes use of phrases such as give me, help me, make the, take away, free me, or equip me. These phrases remind us that success comes from the customers using the product to make progress. It also helps you think about how your product fits in between where they are now and where they want to be. Variations of wording. I\u2019ve used two other wordings. When you describe a JTBD, try a few different ways to say something, and use whichever you and your team prefer. Reverse it: \u201cHelp me have more time to enjoy being a parent, by taking away the stress I deal with when figuring out what products won\u2019t harm my children.\u201d Put it in third person: \u201cFree parents from the stress they deal with when figuring out what products won\u2019t harm their children, so they can have more time to enjoy being parents.\u201d Testing the JTBD. The most important test of wording a JTBD is whether it also describes the solution(s) it replaced. Remember our lessons on creative destruction and JTBD principles: when customers start using a solution for a JTBD, they stop \nFigure 27. A possible description for a JTBD. Note the two parts: (1) the job, (2) when the job is done \u2013 i.e. when the \u201cnew me\u201d is created.",

    },
    {
      "text": "How Might We Describe A Job to be Done? \n 180 \nusing something else. When applying this principle, we see that this description works. When parents started buying multiple products from Honest, they stopped behaviors such as asking friends, family, doctors, and the Internet. The only time when they would go back to any of these previous solutions was when their expectations were violated. For example, one parent described how she bought a sunscreen from Honest without considering any other options. However, her daughter broke out in hives when the sunscreen was applied. This prompted the parent to go search the Internet and talk with people about what sunscreen(s) weren\u2019t safe. She also talked with her doctor to figure out if her daughter had an unknown allergy. A JTBD to note. I chose to share this JTBD because it presents an interesting situation: I believe that many parents are hiring Honest\u2014the brand\u2014more than any individual product. When parents realized they needed a sunblock, they automatically bought one from Honest. This is important because it shows how fatigued parents were in their decision-making process. It also explains why the bundles are a great idea. With these bundles, Honest is telling parents that they don\u2019t need to think about what they need; Honest will take care of it. This delivery service also helps customers develop and maintain a habit of using Honest products. I also like how Honest is offering a collection of products that work together\u2014as a system\u2014to deliver customers progress. These products act as touch points between Honest and various parenting aspirations. It\u2019s as though Honest is a software product that customers subscribe to, and each product is an individual feature. Finally, this example shows a high-level JTBD. How high or low you choose to describe a JTBD is a design and business decision. How you describe a JTBD is a competitive advantage. As mentioned before, I don\u2019t believe that there\u2019s any \u201cright\u201d way to phrase a JTBD. Such a claim would mean that there is no creativity in innovation\u2014that we can just outsource our thinking to some model created by someone else. Every system is one of a kind, and every effort to improve a system should likewise be one of a kind.\n\n182 \n14 GET STARTED TODAY Influencing others Learning Customer Jobs from others jtbd.info Customer Jobs Meetups Contacting meHow you apply Customer Jobs depends on your situation. How much influence do you wield in your team or organization? Are you a designer who needs to persuade a product manager? Are you an entrepreneur or CEO who wields influence over employees? Are you a venture capitalist who wants to make better investments on behalf of your limited partners? How are your leadership and persuasion skills? Do you have access to customers? Do you have a product now, or are your creating a new one from scratch? Each of these circumstances requires a different approach. Without knowing your JTBD\u2014and why you hired this book\u2014it would be wrong of me to tell you what to do next. What I can do is arm you with ideas on choices you can make. I can tell you how other people have solved something and what problems might arise for you as you engage in a course of action. Regardless of what you do next, remember that everyone desires progress, even you. Understand that first, and then figure out the best way to make that progress happen. Finally, this can be your last chapter if you intended to learn just the theory of Customer Jobs. If you want to apply Customer Jobs to discover innovation opportunities, please read on. \nINFLUENCING OTHERS: CUSTOMER JOBS TOP DOWN I\u2019ve introduced Customer Jobs thinking to teammates as a founder and as a product manager. Dan Martell from Clarity introduced Customer Jobs thinking to his team. Morgan Ranieri\u2019s cofounder at YourGrocer insisted on applying Customer Jobs thinking before getting started.

When he was ready to involve everyone else, he explained the high-level concept to them, he gave them tools and techniques on how to interview customers, and then all of them interviewed customers together. Are you being asked to start a company? Insist on Customer Jobs research. When Morgan invited Frankie Trindade to join YourGrocer as technical cofounder, Frankie insisted that they understand their customers\u2019 JTBD before moving ahead with anything. Frankie wanted to make sure an opportunity existed before he left his current job and would be spending his time building the right product since he would be engineering it. Not only did this approach bring the team members together, but it also helped them get started on the right foot. Just do it. But separate the data from your synthesis of them. When I was product manager for FDT, I was responsible only to the CEO. He supported whatever I did as long as I got results. I didn\u2019t ask for permission to apply JTBD thinking; I just did it. I interviewed customers and gathered data, distilled their JTBD, discovered Job Stories, and presented my data and insights to the rest of the team. The catch is that I made sure not to commingle my data with my synthesis of them. This gave the team the opportunity to debate my findings and offer their own interpretations of those data. I also never explicitly claimed that I was applying JTBD principles. I just used the language when presenting the data. Everyone felt involved, and they caught on. They applied Customer Jobs theory without knowing it. \nINFLUENCING OTHERS: CUSTOMER JOBS BOTTOM UP Other Customer Jobs practitioners have kindly shared their experiences in influencing coworkers about Customer Jobs thinking. Create a Customer Jobs theme Meetup, by David Wu: I first applied Customer Jobs theory and practices while leading product management at Meetup. Meetup is a product you can use to organize a local group or find one that you can join. I began applying Customer Jobs principles in my own work and then introduced it to the rest of my team. Once we had made a few successes, we introduced our results in a presentation with the rest of the company.\n\nGet Started Today \n 184 \nI began by interviewing customers myself. Our company had a usability lab that brought in customers almost every day of the week for tests. It wasn\u2019t hard for me to talk with customers after they had completed a usability test. I would talk with them about the first time they had used our product, the last time they used it, and what other products they had used in the past before using Meetup. Once I was comfortable running interviews, I began inviting members of my team to join me. They immediately began seeing the value in talking with customers about their desire for self-betterment and how they were expecting [their lives] to be better with Meetup. We were getting data about specific moments of struggle that would help us design new features and find the right messaging that would connect with customers. My team and I had found value in applying Customer Jobs principles to our work. We wanted to introduce it to the rest of the company, but we had to do it in a way that wouldn\u2019t put people off. We decided to give a short presentation, at lunchtime, about what we had learned about our customers\u2019 struggles. I created a catchy title for the presentation: \u201cWhy People Fire Meetup.\u201d The presentation focused on customers who had churned. I showed pictures of customers who had stopped using our product. Next to those pictures, I displayed quotes about the anxieties they had experienced while using our product. Most of the quotes were related to attending a Meetup for the first time or organizers not knowing how to plan a successful Meetup. Showing the picture of [the customers] who had churned, along with a quote from them about their struggle, had a big impact. Right away, people in the audience started volunteering ideas on how we could fix these problems. There was a lot of positive energy in the room. When the time was right, I explained that I had gathered these data through applying some JTBD principles and practices. This got the JTBD ball rolling at our company.

Your teammates, on the other hand, might try to legitimize design decisions through their own intuition and anecdotal data. This puts you in a tough spot. People are averse to change. You\u2019re more likely to put people off\u2014instead of winning their support\u2014if you try to directly sell them on a new way of doing things. Instead, let them explore their prejudices, anecdotal guesses, and intuition. Then, reframe and massage their stories into a format that everyone can verify. Here is a way you can put your teammates\u2019 hypothesis into a format that you can all test: (1) How are customers currently struggling? (2) What is pushing customers to need a new solution? (3) Without describing the feature, how will the customer\u2019s life be better once the feature exists? (4) What is preventing customers from adopting a new solution? Now you have something that your team can verify. You\u2019ll be in a better position to ask your teammates, \u201cCan I go check this out with a few customers?\u201d Perhaps you can get some customers on to a quick phone call or send a survey. It\u2019s easier to sell \u201cconsumer research\u201d as due diligence and verification of existing assumptions. It\u2019s hard to sell a new process framework. Plus, for people who haven\u2019t yet discovered the value of research, it\u2019s less likely to seem like wasted energy. Over time, your teammates will see the value in understanding the customer\u2019s desire to improve themselves. Then, you\u2019re in a stronger position to request JTBD-style interviews before flushing out a potential feature. \nLEARNING CUSTOMER JOBS FROM OTHERS You may want to learn more about JTBD theory from others and about how others have applied it. This is good, but it has challenges. Customer Jobs has been around for a while, but it\u2019s currently fragmented. Customer Jobs began with Bob Moesta, John Palmer, and Richard Pedi. For many\n\nGet Started Today \n 186 \nyears, it was only a nascent theory with rough edges. These men evolved it as they applied it, and they taught parts of it to clients, friends, coworkers, and academics. The spread of Customer Jobs has been similar to the spread of information in the telephone game; every time it passed from one person to another, it changed a little bit. This is a trade-off when a message is spread quickly, but the result is frustrating for newcomers who want to know which version is \u201cright\u201d or \u201cthe best.\u201d Even Pedi\u2019s, Moesta\u2019s, and Palmer\u2019s ideas on Customer Jobs have diverged. Today, you might think they are talking about completely different things. I, myself, don\u2019t have an allegiance to any single \u201ccorrect\u201d version of Customer Jobs. I don\u2019t want Customer Jobs; I want the progress the theory can deliver me. My advice is not to worry about which way is the correct one to apply Customer Jobs thinking. Pick and choose whatever parts help you; however, I do stick very close to the principles and theory outlined in this book. They have been proven, through practice, to be reliable. I recommend you do the same. \nJTBD.INFO I maintain a collection of Customer Jobs-related articles at jtbd.info. I invite you to read them. I also encourage you, the reader, to submit articles for publication. How have you applied Customer Jobs? Have you created any tools that might help others? Do you have a story to tell? Do you have an idea on how to improve Customer Jobs theory? You can submit an article via jtbd.info by clicking the e-mail or Twitter icons on the front page. My rules for publishing are straightforward. First, the content must be mostly original. It doesn\u2019t help anyone to rephrase what someone else has already said elsewhere. Second, contrary opinions are welcome and encouraged but need to be well formed and supported. Perhaps you disagree with the theory I suggest in this book. That\u2019s great! Just make sure your argument is solid and backed up. Customer Jobs Meetups. A Customer Jobs Meetup (meetup.com) is a great place to discuss Customer Jobs principles and practices and to share stories. David Wu began the JTBD (abbreviated from Customer Jobs) Meetup in New York City, and now I cohost it with him. Running a Meetup. A great way to run a Meetup is to introduce Customer Jobs briefly to anyone new. Then, introduce a product and invite everyone to think",

Use What\u2019s Helpful. Don\u2019t Assume AnythingNote: the content in this chapter originally appeared as a blog post on JTBD.info. It has been added to this second edition because many people find it helpful.\n\nKnow the Two\u200a\u2014\u200aVery\u200a\u2014\u200aDifferent Interpretations of Jobs to be Done \n 188 \nThe popularity of Jobs to be Done has exploded in recent years. This has been both good and bad. On the benefit side, powerful concepts like \u201cprogress\u201d are disseminating throughout design and innovation communities. On the downside, because the phrase \u201cJobs to be Done\u201d has evolved publicly and openly for quite some time, numerous problems have popped up: After Clayton Christensen loosely introduced the phrase in his book, The Innovator\u2019s Solution (2003), many people have offered different interpretations of Jobs to be Done. Newcomers are unaware of the different interpretations. This confuses them and/or discourages them from participating. Criticisms against one interpretation are mistakenly applied to both. This dissuades people from investigating it further. The aim of this chapter will help you: Know the two main interpretations of Jobs to be Done. Be able to quickly find JTBD content that is relevant to you. Understand why people claim why one interpretation is nothing new. Contribute and evolve Jobs theory in a positive, open-source way. \nTWO MODELS: JOBS-AS-PROGRESS; JOBS-AS-ACTIVITIES This chapter will focus on the two, main interpretation of Jobs to be Done. Each has evolved in different ways. And as you will learn, they are also incompatible with each other. The two versions of Job to be Done are: Jobs-As-Progress: a theory that is promoted by Clayton Christensen, Bob Moesta, and myself. Jobs-As-Activities: an ideology and typology promoted by Anthony Ulwick and licensees of his patented Outcome Driven Innovation.\n\nKnow the Two\u200a\u2014\u200aVery\u200a\u2014\u200aDifferent Interpretations of Jobs to be Done \n 189 \nIn an odd coincidence, these two different ideas can be represented side by side in an excerpt from Levitt\u2019s 1983 book, The Marketing Imagination: [The marketing imagination] resides in its implied suggestion as to what to do\u200a\u2014\u200ain this case, find out what problems people are trying to solve. It is represented by Charles Revson\u2019s famous distinction regarding the business of Revlon, Inc.: \u201cIn the factories we make cosmetics. In the drugs stores we sell hope.\u201d It is characterized by Leo McGinneva\u2019s famous clarification about why people buy quarter-inch drill bits:\u201d They don\u2019t want quarter-inch bits. They want quarter-inch holes.\u201d While Levitt wasn\u2019t talking about JTBD, his two examples match the two different interpretations of Job to be Done. Each offers a different opinion on why people buy products. Revson\u2019s customers-want-hope is about results from a change. I buy and use makeup for the first time because I want to change how others perceive me and how I perceive myself. McGinneva\u2019s customers-want-quarter-inch-holes is about results from a use-case. I buy a particular drill bit because I want to make a particular hole.",

BE GOALS Even if you forget everything else in this chapter, make sure you remember figure 28. William Powers\u2019 hierarchy of goals (1973a, 1973b) is a widely accepted model of the relationship between the things we do, and why we do them. Not only does this help with understanding Jobs to be Done, it also helps in understanding other approaches to design and innovation. With regards to JTBD, this model is a typology that describes a few important concepts: The types of goals humans have. \nFigure 28. Powers\u2019 hierarchy of goals as represented in \u201con the self-regulation of behavior\u201d (carver 2001). Also see \u201cmeans-ends\u201d analysis (Newell & Simon 1972).\n\nKnow the Two\u200a\u2014\u200aVery\u200a\u2014\u200aDifferent Interpretations of Jobs to be Done \n 191 \nThe priority order amongst the different types of goals. How the goal types influence each other. The dependency between goal types. Here\u2019s how it works. Different goals. Your ideal self is a synthesis of various Principles or \u201cBe\u201d goals. For example, you think of yourself as a particular type of parent or friend and having a particular set of personal freedoms. These Be goals are what motivate you to choose and carry out one or more Programs or \u201cDo\u201d goals. These Do goals are then fulfilled by Sequences or Motor control goals. \nFigure 29. A dependency inversion exists within our goal system.\n\nKnow the Two\u200a\u2014\u200aVery\u200a\u2014\u200aDifferent Interpretations of Jobs to be Done \n 192 \nBe goals have the highest priority; Motor control goals have the lowest. Be goals are the core drivers of all our actions and decisions. This also means that, no matter how well a Do or Motor Control goal is fulfilled, it\u2019s a failure if the higher Be goal is not satisfied. It also means that a Do goal doesn\u2019t have to be successfully executed to fulfill a Be goal. A fancy way of saying this, is to say that a dependency inversion exists in our goal systems (figure 29). High level goals don\u2019t need low level goals, but low-level goals need high level goals. For example, suppose your goal is to be thoughtful for your family. To fulfill this goal, you choose the activity cook. However, the fulfillment of be thoughtful isn\u2019t dependent on the success or failure of cook dinner. It\u2019s possible that you brilliantly cook dinner, but if your family would have preferred going to a restaurant, you failed. On the other hand, you could be totally unsuccessful at the cook dinner activity, but if your family finds the gesture endearing and thinks of you as being thoughtful anyway, then the activity was a success. Taken even further, Be goals can be fulfilled without even needing to engage in any activity (Carver 2001). For example, suppose you live in a neighborhood that has high crime. This high crime made you feel unsafe (an unattained Be goal). Then, without any action on your part, the local police start 24/7 patrolling. Immediately, you start feeling safer. Over time, crime reduces, and you become safe. Your life-situation (your collection of Be goals) has changed even though you didn\u2019t carry out any activities or tasks (Do or Motor control goals). Be goals are the most stable; Do and Motor control goals are transitory. Be goals are states of self-perception. They are entirely emotional (or psychological if you prefer that word). Do and Motor control goals are purely functional and are technology dependent. They are things you do to fulfill a Be goal. Stated another way: You don\u2019t ultimately want to achieve the Do and Motor goals; you want the Be goals.",

As illustrated by Powers and Carver, humans switch between and even combine multiple Do and Motor control goals as they aim to fulfill Be goals. For example, in my pursuit to \u201cbe thoughtful\u201d, I might cook dinner, buy wine, write a poem, and make a home video. A real example of this behavior appears later in the article. Now we\u2019re ready to get into the two interpretations of JTBD. \nJOBS-AS-ACTIVITIES Determining how Jobs came to be associated with tasks and activities is tricky. The phrase Jobs to be Done, with regards to an innovation ideology, was first used by Clayton Christensen (Christensen 2003). In it he references: Rick Pedi as having \u201ccoined for us the language Jobs to be Done\u201d (this account is expanded in Christensen\u2019s 2016 book). Anthony Ulwick of Strategyn as having \u201cused a very similar concept in his consulting work, using the phrase outcomes that customers are seeking.\u201d \nFigure 30. Ulwick sees jobs as activities and tasks (Ulwick 2005).\n\nKnow the Two\u200a\u2014\u200aVery\u200a\u2014\u200aDifferent Interpretations of Jobs to be Done \n 194 \nJames J. Gibson\u2019s theory of affordances as \u201cbeing a concept that mirrors what we term jobs or outcomes.\u201d However, Christensen never defined what a Job to be Done was, nor used it with rigor. Christensen gives examples of Job such as make the commute more interesting, placate children, feel like loving parents, and use small snippets of time productively (Christensen 2003). If you were to put these examples against Powers\u2019 goal hierarchy, they range from low-level Motor control goals to high level Be goals. I asked Clay\u2019s team about this discrepancy when I met with them to develop the Jobs-As-Progress model. Their answer was that, back in 2003 they were just starting to develop the theory. As a result, some ambiguity existed. The most notable instance of interpreting Jobs-As-Activities is from Anthony Ulwick (Ulwick 2005, 2016). What is it? Ulwick is the primary proponent of the idea of Jobs-As-Activities. As an example of this thinking, Ulwick cites McGinneva\u2019s \u201cCustomers want a quarter inch hole\u2026\u201d quote (Ulwick 2016). In his 2005 book, Ulwick describes a Job to be Done as: [Companies] must know which jobs their customers are trying to get done (that is, the tasks or activities customers are trying to carry out). In his 2016 book, he defines a Job to be Done as: A task, goal or objective a person is trying to accomplish or a problem they are trying to resolve. A job can be functional, emotional or associated with product consumption (consumption chain jobs). A Job to be Done is then described in terms of a Job Map: Analysis of hundreds of jobs has revealed that all jobs consist of some or all of the eight fundamental process steps: define, locate, prepare, confirm, execute, monitor, modify and conclude (see the universal job map). Ulwick defines Jobs to be Done as:",

      "text": "Know the Two\u200a\u2014\u200aVery\u200a\u2014\u200aDifferent Interpretations of Jobs to be Done \n 195 \nJobs-to-be-Done Theory provides a framework for (i) categorizing, defining, capturing, and organizing all your customer\u2019s needs, and (ii) tying customer-defined performance metrics (in the form of desired outcome statements) to the Job-to-be-Done. With regards to being called a \u201ctheory\u201d, the description given is not of a theory, but of an Ideology and Typology. A theory is a hypothesis of how and why a natural or social phenomenon happens\u200a\u2014\u200ae.g. evolution, gravity, bending of space-time. On the other hand, an ideology is a belief system (e.g. a strategy) and a typology is a categorization schema (Bacharach 1989, Bhattacherjee 2012, Colquitt 2007). Ulwick\u2019s Jobs-As-Activities suggests that customers want to do these activities. Examples of Jobs in this model include listen to music, drill a quarter-inch hole, storing-retrieving music, and cutting a piece of wood. As a result, the activity becomes the fundamental unit of analysis. Any emotional considerations are secondary to this core, functional Job: Emotional jobs define how customers want to feel or avoid feeling as a result of executing the core functional job. Social jobs define how the customer wants to be perceived by others. The core functional job is the anchor around which all other needs are defined. It is defined first, then the emotional, related and consumption chain jobs are defined relative to the core functional job. Within the Powers model, a Job to be Done in this interpretation is a Program made up of Sequences\u200a\u2014\u200aor Do goals made up of Motor control goals. What is it based upon or similar to? Those who have experience in Goal-Directed Design, Cognitive Task Analysis, Hierarchical Task Analysis, Human Computer Interaction (HCI), Use Cases, or Activity-Centered Design will\n\nKnow the Two\u200a\u2014\u200aVery\u200a\u2014\u200aDifferent Interpretations of Jobs to be Done \n 196 \nrecognize this interpretation of JTBD as similar to what they are already doing (figure 31), and the notion of \u201cdesired outcomes\u201d is also similar to Sayan Chatterjee\u2019s paper, Delivering desired outcomes efficiently: the creative key to competitive strategy (Chatterjee 1998). The many similarities of Jobs-As-Activities model has with these other existing ideas is why a lot of people claim that Jobs to be Done is nothing new. For example, Ulwick\u2019s Job Map is very similar to Norman\u2019s Seven Stages of Action (figure 32). They\u2019re not exactly the same, but they are strikingly similar. Both are based upon the idea of a person physically interacting with a technology through three phases: planning, doing, and evaluating. Both Don Norman and Anthony Ulwick even use listen to music as an example of an activity. Here\u2019s how Norman describes the activity of listen to music in his 2013 edition of his 1988 book: Focusing upon tasks is too limiting. Apple\u2019s success with its music player, the iPod, was because Apple supported the entire activity \nFigure 31. \u201cWarm up furnace\u201d is an example of task analysis. Ulwick's idea of jobs to be done is similar to task analysis.\n\nKnow the Two\u200a\u2014\u200aVery\u200a\u2014\u200aDifferent Interpretations of Jobs to be Done \n 197 \ninvolved in listening to music: discovering it, purchasing it, getting it into the music player, developing playlists (that could be shared), and listening to the music. The biggest difference between Ulwick\u2019s Jobs-As-Activities model and HCI, Activity Centered Design, Goal-Directed Design, Cognitive Tasks analysis, and Use Cases is the addition of a business strategy layer. Ulwick\u2019s ideology suggests that businesses should focus on creating technologies that help consumers better execute tasks and activities (Ulwick 2016): New products and services win in the marketplace if they help customers get a job done better (faster, more predictably, with higher output) and / or more cheaply. \nJOBS-AS-PROGRESS The first mention of Jobs as Progress is in the Jobs to be Done Handbook (Spiek & Moesta 2014). But this book was about an interview method and doesn\u2019t get into Customer Jobs theory. Currently, there are only two books that focus on Jobs as \nFigure 32.

In Competing Against Luck Christensen writes: It was Bob and his partner Rick Pedi who first brought me the puzzle that eventually led to the Theory of Jobs to Be Done and his work in \nthe years since has helped shape it. No references to Gibson, Ulwick, affordances, or desired outcomes appear in Christensen\u2019s Competing Against Luck. Instead, Christensen replaces the idea that customers want \u201coutcomes\u201d with customers want \u201cprogress\u201d. This Jobs-As-Progress model is the version Christensen, Moesta, and I promote. What is it? Jobs-As-Progress is a theory only. Theory tells you how and why things happen, not what you should do about it. Theory is descriptive, not prescriptive. Jobs-As-Progress aims to answer several social phenomena such as: What causes someone to purchase a product for the first time? Why and how do consumers use markets to adapt in a changing world. Why and how do consumers shop (search for new products, services, and technologies)? Why and how do consumers switch between products? The Jobs-As-Progress model suggests (hypothesizes) that a consumer will look for, buy, and use a product for the first time when a discrepancy exists between how things are today and how they want them to be in the future (recall Revlon\u2019s \u201cin the drug store we sell hope\u2026\u201d quote and Powers\u2019 \u201cBe\u201d goal). Jobs-As-Progress is about a consumer\u2019s desire to use markets with the aim of resolving a Be goal discrepancy. \nFigure 33. A visualization of a Job to be Done and \u201cprogress\u201d.\n\nKnow the Two\u200a\u2014\u200aVery\u200a\u2014\u200aDifferent Interpretations of Jobs to be Done \n 199 \nTwo definitions of a Job to be Done in this model are: We define a \u201cjob\u201d as the progress that a person is trying to make in a particular circumstance (Christensen 2016). A Job to be Done is the process a consumer goes through whenever she aims to transform her existing life-situation into a preferred one but cannot because constraints are stopping her (Klement 2016). One key to this model is to recognize that Jobs-As-Progress is about understanding why consumers change their historical purchase patterns\u200a\u2014\u200ai.e. why they would stop using product X and start using product Y. Understanding what conditions must exist for this behavior change is important. If you want people to start using your \nFigure 34. In \u201cthe why before the why\u201d, basecamp founder Jason Fried writes about four jobs (Be goal discrepancies) that cause people to seek out solution that would enable them to change their life-situation.\n\nKnow the Two\u200a\u2014\u200aVery\u200a\u2014\u200aDifferent Interpretations of Jobs to be Done \n 200 \nproduct (i.e. create growth), then you\u2019re gonna have to persuade them to stop using the products they use today and start using your product. The other key to this model is to recognize that it\u2019s about unattained Be goals (Figure 34). It\u2019s not about Do or Motor control goals. Jobs-As- Progress recognizes that tasks and activities are a means to an end only. They do not represent what consumers want. This realization helps us understand how consumers see and use markets. Until the Jobs-As-Progress model came along, most companies restricted competition to products that shared functionality (e.g. products that \u201ccut a straight line\u201d). However, because customers see tasks and activities as a means to end only, consumers end up considering products and services that vary greatly on functionality. This is clear in the Clarity case study from this book. In this example, Clarity founder Dan Martell learned that a lot of his customers were coming to Clarity because they had a Be goal discrepancy around being motivated and inspired. This discrepancy caused them to investigate and evaluate activities that ranged from \u201cattend to a conference\u201d to \u201cvideo chat with a famous person\u201d. Even though these \nFigure 35. Dan Martell of clarity (clarity.fm) applied a jobs-as-progress model to grow and eventually sell his business. He understood that consumers were trying to resolve a be goal discrepancy, and that various solutions could be used to resolve it.",

The Jobs-as-Progress model suggests that a great deal of innovation is about eliminating tasks and activities\u200a\u2014\u200anot designing for them. IKEA\u2019s innovation was to create furniture that you could order and assemble yourself without needing to \u201ccut a straight line\u201d, \u201cdrill a quarter inch hole\u201d, or even \u201cwant a quarter inch hole\u201d. Moreover, in 2017, IKEA bought Task Rabbit. Why? Because they also understand that people don\u2019t want to \u201cassemble/build furniture\u201d either. Rather, they want to be organized, express their individuality, and feel comfortable in their home. What is it based upon or similar to? The theoretical basis of Jobs-As-Progress draws from many sources\u200a\u2014\u200atoo many to list here. The most import parts (humans as goal-directed organisms that self-regulate discrepancies via feedback loops) stems from people such as Norbert Wiener (1961), Herbert Simon (1996), Albert Bandura (1997), Charles S. Carver (2001), and William Powers (1972). I am not aware of these ideas as having been used within the context of innovation or design. The closest thing to it would be Cooper\u2019s Goal-Directed Design and Hassenzahl\u2019s Experience Design (Hassenzahl 2010). However, even these are different. Goal-Directed Design is a method while Experience Design is an ideology. Neither of these aims to explain why or how any natural or social phenomena happen. \nTWO DIFFERENT, INCOMPATIBLE MODELS If it isn\u2019t clear, these are two different, and incompatible, interpretations of why we buy and use products. The Jobs-As-Activities model suggests that customers want to engage in the activity; therefore, your efforts should be to improve that activity.\n\nKnow the Two\u200a\u2014\u200aVery\u200a\u2014\u200aDifferent Interpretations of Jobs to be Done \n 202 \nWhereas the Jobs-As-Progress model suggests that there\u2019s nothing functional or activity related about a JTBD. Why? Because it is technologies that function, not our desires. Don Norman (1988) also offers his opinion about focusing on tasks or activities only: Most innovation is done as an incremental enhancement of existing products. What about radical ideas, ones that introduce new product categories to the marketplace? These come about by reconsidering the goals, and always asking why the real goal is: what is called root cause analysis. Harvard Business School marketing professor Theodore Levitt once pointed out, \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole!\u201d Levitt\u2019s example of the drill implying that the goal is really a hole is only partially correct, however. When people go to a store to buy a drill, that is not their real goal. But why would anyone want a quarter-inch hole? Clearly that is an intermediate goal. Perhaps they wanted to hang shelves on the wall. Levitt stopped too soon. Once you realize that they don\u2019t really want the drill, you realize that perhaps they don\u2019t really want the hole, either: they want to install their bookshelves. Why not develop methods that don\u2019t require holes? \nFigure 36. The Jobs-as-Progress model suggests that we create technologies, so we can skip having to \u201cdo things\u201d and have more time to enjoy a particular life-situation.",

(Yes, I know: electronic books, e-books.) Rather, a consumer\u2019s ultimate motivation is to regulate a discrepancy they have amongst Be goals. e.g. help me become financially stable, make me confident and impress others. In their pursuit of this goal, consumers may engage in one or more activities\u2026or maybe they don\u2019t engage in any activity at all. For example, the Jobs-As-Progress models suggest that people don\u2019t want to mow the lawn. They do so only because they own grass and grass grows (and dies). Avoiding having to \u201cmow the lawn\u201d is why innovations such as lawn-care services, automated lawn mowers, and field turf (fake grass) exist. Perhaps one day GMO grass will be created that won\u2019t ever have to be cut. \nCHALLENGES IN UNDERSTANDING A TANGLED MESS It\u2019s impossible to predict the future of Customer Jobs theory; however, one thing is for sure: a lot of people are confused. Moreover, there\u2019s little reason to think that will change in the future. Two reasons are: Misattributions. One challenge with advancing Customer Jobs theory, is how many people repeat what others have written or said without investigating sources. For example, Alex Osterwalder wrote (2014): The jobs to be done concept was developed independently by several business thinkers including Anthony Ulwick of the consulting firm Strategyn, consultants Rick Pedi and Bob Moesta, and Professor Denise Nitterhouse of DePaul University. It was popularized by Clay Christensen and his consulting firm Innosight and Anthony Ulwick\u2019s Strategyn. Here Osterwalder is trying to give due credit, but accidentally adds to the confusion: The citation makes it seem like Christensen, Nitterhouse, Moesta, Ulwick, and Pedi are talking about the same thing\u200a\u2014\u200awhile they are discussing wildly different things Christensen (2017) writes that Pedi and Moesta (not Ulwick and Nitterhouse) were the originators of Customer Jobs thinking\n\nKnow the Two\u200a\u2014\u200aVery\u200a\u2014\u200aDifferent Interpretations of Jobs to be Done \n 204 \nWhile Denise Nitterhouse was cited as a co-author of the article \u201cFinding the Right Job For Your Product\u201d (Christensen et al 2007), she\u2019s a proponent of Customer Case Research (Berstell, Nitterhouse 1997) which isn\u2019t about JTBD. Moreover, a comment by \u201cDenise Nitterhouse\u201d claims that Nitterhouse is mistakenly attributed with the milkshake story (see article by Derek Christensen). Repeating nascent, or passing, ideas as if they are well researched. Here\u2019s another challenge facing the future of JTBD: ideas are repeated without any proof or investigation of it\u2019s sources. For example, the idea that there are functional, social, and emotional jobs originates from just one line (Christensen 2003): The functional, emotional, and social dimensions of the jobs that customers need to get done constitute the circumstances in which they buy. That\u2019s it! Just one line. No evidence, citation, or further clarification is given. Over the years, many people have repeated and expanded upon this ontology of Jobs\u2026but there\u2019s no experimental data or theoretical basis to support it. It\u2019s a textbook example of Argumentum ad Populum (i.e. \u201cIf many believe so, it is so\u201d). \nTHE FUTURE? USE WHAT\u2019S HELPFUL. DON\u2019T ASSUME ANYTHING If you choose to get deeper into JTBD, know that it is quite the rabbit hole\u200a\u2014\u200afor better or worse. My advice is to remain pragmatic, use what you feel is helpful, and be skeptical of what other people write and talk about. The ultimate goal is to be great at making products that people will buy. The rest is just a means to that end. \nREFERENCES Bacharach, S. B. (1989). Organizational theories: Some criteria for evaluation. Academy of management review, 14(4), 496\u2013515. Bandura, A.

The key difference, however, is that a JTBD describes how a customer changes or wishes to change. With this in mind, we define a JTBD as follows: A Job to be Done is the process a consumer goes through whenever she aims to transform her existing life-situation into a preferred one but cannot because there are constraints that stop her. What Isn\u2019t A Customer Job? If you are in doubt whether someone is describing a customer\u2019s JTBD, ask these questions: Does this describe an action? Can I visualize someone doing this? If you answer \u201cyes\u201d to these questions, you\u2019re probably describing a solution for a JTBD and not a JTBD itself. Remember, a JTBD is not a task, activity, or has any functional characteristic. It describes a customer\u2019s desire to improve him-/herself\u2014something that can neither be seen nor can be described in terms of actions or functional qualities. What About Different Types of Jobs? It is best to avoid coming up with different types of Jobs or stratifying them. Any attempt to do so will lead to logical inconsistencies and overlaps. It\u2019s best to keep it simple: each Job is a combination of various emotional forces. What Are JTBD Principles? Customers don\u2019t want your product or what it does; they want help making their lives better (i.e., they want progress). People have Jobs; things don\u2019t.",

      "text": "A Summary of Customer Jobs \n 208 \nCompetition is defined in the minds of customers, and they use progress as their criterion. When customers start using a solution for a JTBD, they stop using something else. Innovation opportunities exist when customers exhibit compensatory behaviors. Favor progress over outcomes and goals. Progress defines value; contrast reveals value. Solutions for Jobs deliver value beyond the moment of use. Producers, consumers, solutions, and Jobs should be thought of as parts of a system that work together to evolve markets.\n\n209 \n17 APPENDIX: SUMMARY OF PUTTING CUSTOMER JOBS TO WORK Chapter 4Ask customers about what they\u2019ve done, not just what they want. Confirm it if you can. Ask the right questions to learn how your customers view competition. Learn what kind of progress customers are seeking. What\u2019s their emotional motivation (JTBD)? Use that to segment competition. Ask yourself, \u201cFrom which budget will my product take away money?\u201d Create better marketing material by speaking to your customers\u2019 JTBD. Focus on delivering emotional progress (getting a Job Done). Don\u2019t focus solely on functionality. Chapter 5 How do you convince teammates or management to change a product? Frame design challenges as a JTBD. Dig deeper when you tap into a struggle or aspiration. How have customers tried to solve it before? Determine if anxiety is a competitor. If it is, find ways of reducing it. Be suspicious of the \u201cimpulse purchase\u201d concept. No purchase is random. Chapter 6 Don\u2019t depend on demographics. Create better advertising and promotional material by speaking to what customers value. Teams become more motivated, build consensus, and share a vision when they do JTBD research together.\n\nSummary of Putting Customer Jobs to Work \n 210 \nChapter 7 First, study the push and pull. Dig into inertia and anxiety after identifying push and pull. Fight anxiety and generate pull by helping customers visualize the progress they will make by using your product. Reduce anxiety-in-choice with trials, refunds, and discounts. Identify any habits-in-use that keep customers from using your product. Adjust your product to help them along. Chapter 8 Create a constancy of purpose to innovate for your organization. Discover the customers\u2019 JTBD by focusing on what doesn\u2019t change. Before you make anything, have a clear picture in your mind of what customers will stop doing. Chapter 9 Don\u2019t restrict competition to products with similar functionality or physical characteristics. Talk with your customers! Confirm that competition exists between products by finding customers who switched. Do you think you\u2019re creating a new market? Think again. Know what budget you\u2019re taking away from. Continually refresh the competitive landscape with ongoing feedback from customers. Remember that not every JTBD needs to be solved with a product that customers buy.\n\nSummary of Putting Customer Jobs to Work \n 211 \nChapter 10 Begin by identifying a struggle or aspiration. Start wide and get progressively narrow. Find innovation opportunities when customers exhibit compensatory behaviors. Chapter 11 Innovation opportunities are found through looking for specific data. Know the difference between a struggling customer and a merely inconvenienced customer. Great advertising comes from speaking to the customers\u2019 struggling moment. Digging deep into customer motivation reveals innovation opportunities. You can deliver progress to your customers\u2019 JTBD by offering a set of products that work together as a system. Chapter 12 Grow your business, reduce churn, and capture more profits by delivering progress to customers. Unlock your innovation creativity by asking, \u201cWhat comes after?\u201d Chapter 13 Grow your business by unlocking new aspirations and offering products for them. Think of your business as delivering a combination of products that work together to forward the system of progress. Find product opportunities by looking forward and backward on the system of progress. Chapter 14\n\nSummary of Putting Customer Jobs to Work \n 212 \nPersuade customers to reject their current products by changing their JTBD. Bring focus to which system of progress you\u2019re solving for by splitting up products that deliver different types of progress.",
