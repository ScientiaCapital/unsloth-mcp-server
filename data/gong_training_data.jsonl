So, you know, enterflow is, very good. We've been with them for a bit and there's continued growth as far as that goes. But is there a better means in which it's a merger of solutions? We really like housecall pro. It's great on our customer service and we've had, we have no complaints as far as that goes as far as, and we use it heavily for our customer service side, not as much for the installation side of it too much, but we use it a lot with our site visits, final inspections and all of our service calls. But yeah, just trying to see. Is there a better means because scoops never tried to pitch themselves as an all in one tool. They've always, you know, tried to position and prop themselves as they'll try to integrate with everything. But then you're always going to still have a measurement of movement pieces. Integrations are the biggest thing that can create wrinkles because does it work the way that it's intended or thought to be right? If this trigger happens, does that trigger happen? Do those things really take place? Like you need to be having the multiple platforms? Does create some of that little bit of wrinkle that always needs to be ironed out a little bit. You know, companycam and scoop has their online, their apps for their phones and stuff like that too. But still, if there's a better integration or a movement tool as to, I really like, you know, Jeremy's site visits that get captured and, you know, the reports that get put out as far as that goes very well be that scoop kind of can do the full format too. But you're always trying to tweak and modify along the way. It's not that it's just solar industry or it's whatever the case is. And so that's kind of really where it's at it's. Not that we have any major hiccups or problems with where we're currently at. It's just in conversation with Jeremy and kind of going back and forth about stuff. As far as that goes. He's like he really, he loves your guys' product. And so it's just like, you know, we haven't taken a look at it.

But I do just want to flash quickly. We've this has been really helpful for maybe I'll just make this a little bit bigger here. This has been and maybe change the aspect ratio. There we go. These metrics have been really helpful in trying to determine if there's a mutual fit for coperniq. Quite frankly, if you're not seeing these as significant enough painful enough, then it's probably fine for you to keep what you've got going.

So that's PMS operations executive teams if they want read write access, which usually is the case especially when it comes to analytics. And I mean we have, oh, and then sales would also be included in those office seats. We have field seats which are mobile app only. So that's your field technicians, them seeing their work coming in, them seeing their schedule, them being able to geolocate and provide an Uber experience for your dispatchers and your customers. And then there's a read only seat. So that's I mean, maybe a coordinator who doesn't have to make any edits or updates in the system. That seat's only 10 dollars. So it's you know, it's pretty marginal there that being said, we can definitely, I think, you know, when the topic comes up with maybe like subcontractors or people that you're adding just for a commercial project, we can work with you on making sure that our commercial, you know, our commercial plan makes sense. So, yeah, you know, I think we have a good idea to jump into the platform initially. I will kind of caution is that without kind of those metrics\u2026 we're without visibility into those metrics, kind of looking at this as a latent problem which I think maybe Thomas, you would agree. I mean, you did mention it seems like what you have right now, you don't have any complaints. I'm not sharing my screen yet, but as we go through this, let's keep it kind of interactive. Let me know if you have any questions or anything that comes to mind. But here's the client view just to orient ourselves. The client record is the parent record within coperniq across sales, project, installation, management, construction, and even the ongoing relationship. Once a job is done for the o M for your orphan systems et cetera. So a client could be a prospect if they came through one of your maybe canvassing or form fill base for a customer. If we have a signed agreement and construction is either in progress or completed. And we integrate directly with scanify with opensolar, I mean Aurora solar, what have you? And so these are bi directionally synced so much so that when you create a trigger in opensolar as the example here, that will then, so opensolar contract is completed that will enter the project into a specific workflow and will pull over all the default mappings\u2026 highlighting this because you mentioned having a consolidated system represents a lot of advantages and making sure that there's no wrinkles being added, right? And we're pulling all the right information. So tightly bi directionally, synced, you make the updates here. It's updating in opensolar, and you can even add custom mapping as I'm sure west coast solar has developed your own nuance\u2026 and we also integrate in the same fashion with quickbooks. Bi directionally, synced. You can make updates either or, and they would be updated. And from a sales perspective before we hop over to projects, this is another way that you can create a project automatically is when one of your sales processes in coperniq concludes with a signed agreement. And so we have resi service request here. We have your sales pipeline for projects. These are all customizable to make sure we include all of your different sources for clients. And you can customize the different stages for these. And you can make calls directly through here. You can see salespeople can set reminders, they can see a central feed of notes and add notes that then will be available and visible to the project side as well and see any properties or documents, or issue quotes or proposals for the, and you'll notice here. I can even create a project in opensolar. So you can have a flow where you run through the sales side inside of coperniq and then you go to opensolar for the design and then pull it back into coperniq for projects."}], "_metadata": {"source": "gong", "call_id": "5797609360022005905", "category": "gong_real"}}

If you have sales managers. This is also they would more so be looking at this 10,000 foot portfolio view, right? While a sales rep will actually filter down and they'd filter just for themselves and only be looking at like their, also you can set the customization the users and just make it so all salespeople can only see their projects especially if you have a, I don't know if you guys have like a dealer model or something like that. Perfect. So that's the sales side. Once you have a project created, it'll enter one of these specific workflows. And right now what we're looking at is the portfolio view of projects. You can drill this down however you want to. So if you have different PMS that are only working on resi, or you have specialized PMS that are working on commercial, or maybe you want to cut this up by jurisdiction or o M and services separate. But no matter which way you cut this up, you're going to be able to see. Okay. So within resi, solar and battery, we can see by these emblems\u2026 here, what kind of work is being done in this case for Sean fabro. So he's doing solar roofing and storage. We can see an SLA flag. So there's a yellow flag in my demo environment. Everything's red flagged. I should really update that, but we're able to quickly see how much this product is delayed past an acceptable SLA. And while being able to see what phase each project is in is nice. A more productive and valuable question is what's preventing Sean fabro? Angelina Jolie. Our two mark tract projects from moving on to the next stage, which is site survey. And we can easily hover over in progress here. And we can see the work orders that are preventing them from moving to the next stage and even what status it's in. So we see the design is requested but not completed. We see that the perfect packet is assigned but not completed by the sales rep. And we can actually click directly into these work orders and go straight to that work order. Actually if I need to tag the rep, you\u2026 know, where's the perfect packet\u2026 and even change the status, what have you? So we can basically action the entire work order from that view. Now when we go into one of these projects here, I'll go in the example of Keanu reeves. This is the project record. You'll see we also have a folder system for our data architecture. So under, if I were to exit out of this project, I'll be in the site. View. So if Keanu reeves has multiple sites now, I'm just looking at his Fresno location. And if I go to Keanu reeves, I can see that he has a Fresno and a San Francisco location here. And I can click directly back into that project and vice versa to kind of zoom in. You'll notice too that as I was doing that this central feed was changing in what was included here. And that's because based on the lens that you're looking through or the specific project or site or what have you, we're filtering down for what comments are relevant for that project. And so within here, we can see that there was a comment I had made a comment on the tech side audit, specifically, right? And so that's actually linked here for this project or the site survey. In this case, I've made a comment about the picture. So if I were to click on that, I would be able to go straight to the site survey. See all the pictures. Make any additional comments, check if the correct photo was uploaded, et cetera. And if we just look at the workflow here, we'll see that. Okay. So we have the different phases for the construction workflow. And once all of the phases are completed or all the steps are completed, it'll automatically close that phase and open up the next ones. And we can create a lot of automation and conditional logic around these work orders being opened. Solar is the most complex as far as trades in terms of order of operations permitting, especially when you get into commercial, right? So we can create a lot of conditional logic to be able to run things in parallel and still have guardrails. So, for example, this plan sets here is blocking DC or solar work order because we need to make sure we have the plan sets available. And we even have flags for missing information that we can then just update in terms of the module model in this case. But that's generally how the workflows work here. Yeah.

So then really having an integrated tight system, I think you're starting to see the potential as far as how it can impact operations, overall conditional logic as well. We can say tech site audit is blocking design and engineering. So that design and engineering is not even going to have to keep checking on, you know, do they have the right information? They know every time their work order opens up that they have all of the relevant information and it's already been approved and reviewed and approved by a PM to ensure that all the right pictures are there.

Actually that's a really sharp observation by you Thomas, because all of the way that coperniq is designed is to ensure that no information or context gets lost. And I'm going to highlight two ways we do that. So, the first way is when we're looking at forms as an example, these, the information here that's added, if it exists somewhere else in coperniq, they will be preloaded. So if you have like, you know, the site address or information around the roofing angle or whatnot, going back to do service, you're going to have all that information at the tip or at your fingertips even from the execution angle of the actual form and site survey. The other way is that we actually we've I recently I had a client who was asking for, hey, like, you know, we might have a change order at the permitting process or something like that. And we want you as our current process today to reopen design and engineering the work order and reopen it. So it can be like restarted or, you know, edited or whatnot, we do not allow that because that compromises the data integrity because we have the design and engineering work order, it is completed. We have all the information. So instead our workflow is a change order process. So you, in that way you'd submit a change order at permitting and then we'd have a cascade effect of it opening up a new change order for design and engineering, maybe a new change order for site survey that way, a year, two years, three years down the line. When someone looks back, they have basically the story is complete and it's accurate and you have all the information you need."}], "_metadata": {"source": "gong", "call_id": "5797609360022005905", "category": "gong_real"}}

Yeah, I think I'll just show you how the project notifications work here. So, this is the homeowner portal within coperniq or the client portal in the case of commercial, but this would be west coast solar, your logo and your branding. They have a chat availability for them to chat with your team back to your central feed. They can see who's completed or who's scheduled for different service work. In Matthew's case, he has multiple in progress work. So he has energy efficiency here. It looks like this is for storage. He can upload a document and pretty soon he's going to be able to sign a document with our internal DocuSign feature and he can see also his system health. We support enphase, solaredge and tesla today for monitoring and they can refer and earn. So also replacing, I don't know if you guys have used get the referral or something similar. This would, of course, because it's all one system, create a referral and sales opportunity on the sales side of coperniq. And along that topic, the, you know, your 5,000 residential customers, they can opt themselves in to any other services you do here. So, and that would also create a sales opportunity, pull all the information. They can leave you a review on all the relevant sites, Google yelp, BBB, and you can push documents to their portal here as well. So whether that's tax documents, contracts, yeah\u2026 anything that would be relevant here. So when someone's going on site or reviewing something with a client, you can actually just pull this up if you'd like to.

I can't show you, but if someone does mark on the way it shows their route, it also shows any. So, it also signifies undispatched\u2026 work orders and which routes are still yet to be completed. Okay. So, maybe on the next call, I can show you a live environment and I can show you how clean that dispatching works. Okay? But the other critical thing is, let's say, for the sake of showing here, let's say I'm sending myself to this Oakland's work order, but let's pretend there's another electrical work order here that I am eligible for. Let's say you're dispatching me and you notice that, and you say, okay, well, let's go ahead and assign this to Levi after he completes this work order. And now, we've been very efficient with our dispatch of sources, right? Yeah, we can definitely go deeper on this topic and we should, when we look at the mobile app. But the other thing to show you here is going to be the, well, actually, before we touch on analytics, I just want to show you a couple examples of smart views. So, this is a like a task list. This is my task list. And because this is a demo, I mean, I have everything from office work to site surveys. But this is extremely effective in allowing somebody to just click into their work orders, execute them and clear their queue. Yeah. So a really strong example of a smart view.

Yeah, the labor hours and stuff. Okay? So let's assume right now, you know, we're done with like selling and, you know, won the deal. Now, I want to close one, the request.

On the right hand side is, you know, how you orchestrate them. So you have field work orders, office work orders, forms, document requests, there's also invoicing billing and scheduling. And what you do is you drop and drag them here, right? And set up your processes. So I can change these to something\u2026 like legal research. Site survey\u2026 quality control. All right. Okay.

And if\u2026 I were to go back to the project itself\u2026 and I finished these, so I come over here just, okay, finish these work orders canceled. Okay? Perfect.

So you would go to the dispatcher over here and you're able to filter for example, all my, you know, for example, technical. Site surveys. Okay. And now I can see, I have for Armstrong and associates, which is queued up. So what I can do is come over here and schedule this for Tuesday and even sometimes you can schedule things multiple visits, right? So I can come here.

On invoice, 50 percent of the total scope\u2026 great invoice. And then I can create another invoice for another 50 percent, right? And if it's monthly progress, you're able to. Choose the line item. So you choose from the scope of work, right? Of what you want to bill. And then, so that's invoices bills is when you want to pay people essentially, right? Yeah. So if, you know, hire someone to help with some of the work, you can use bill to pay them out. So you can track all of this within the project. So if I were to send this to the client, this is okay. Oh, oops. I have to add the due date. If I were to send this to the client, they would come over here, preview portal as a client. So I'm not sure if, you know, this would be a good experience for your people you work with. But essentially, you're able to have your own portal. So this is for example, how one of our customers has it. So this is their website. On the top, right? There is a customer portal\u2026 and their customers just log in with a phone number and copy and paste six digit code. Once they log in, it looks something like this where they can see the progress of the project, any\u2026 quotes, or requests\u2026 any type of invoicing\u2026 and they can pay by card. Bank, Google\u2026 pay, apple pay. They can see all their previous projects and services. You can share any type of documentations with them directly through the client portal, right? And as you dispatch these, you know, works to your technicians, you're able to do things like this, which is for example, geolocate them, right? Choose, who do you want to geolocate geofencing, being only able to clock in once they're inside the geofence of the area or not automatically clocking in? Automatically clocking out once they're inside that geofence, and only allow users, you know, to clock in once they're inside that geofence. So, for example, you know, the field technician view would look something like this, where they have here the homepage and they're able to see, okay, what their route looks like for the day. So, for example, there was like a site survey at Elon's house. They clocked out. And now they have another one over here. They're able to, you know, click and see what they have for the day. Any, you know, we can calculate on their way. And when they're clocked in any pictures and videos they've taken. Their schedules for the day, their inbox. So it's very simple mobile app. But, you know, I mean there's also, you know, the analytics part of things and stuff, but I'll stop here and see what you guys think. In general. I feel like, you know, there might not be, you know, much of a fit on the sales side of things like we can help with the proposal and stuff. But it seems like you guys already have a certain way to do calculations. But if you guys want to standardize your processes especially on the project side of things, then that's where, you know, we can help a lot, but I'll pause here and just hear your feedback."}], "_metadata": {"source": "gong", "call_id": "3800863110382100758", "category": "gong_real"}}

This special assignee, the property type here is based on a person, it means that you could assign someone who has access to the coperniq system to this property here. Okay?

And then on the property is what I did was this, I did show empty properties taken special? I selected Franklin tests. In this case, we're simulating that person who's outside of your company. Okay? And then I also gave Franklin test guys role\u2026 meaning that he, Franklin test will only see whatever that setting is that I showed you earlier sure, meaning his records only. In this case, his is defined by him being selected on this special assignee field while the rest is still assigned to other people. Okay? So I'm going to go ahead and log on as Franklin test that person. Okay? Franklin plus R at this here. So when I log on, you notice that because the\u2026 properties is\u2026 assigned to\u2026 Franklin tests, you see Franklin tests down here, he only sees that project\u2026 and that's it nothing else. So it means that you could as an admin, what you can do is you could go like for example, if I go back to the admin access of arf, right? I could actually just pick a bunch of projects and I want to give him a special assignee. And then he will only see those projects. So when the first thing you need to do obviously is to create a user for Ty's role.

Ask discovery questions. Use the Challenger Sale approach."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I actually, and you know, it's funny. You and I are actually also on the same page, the idea is that we kind of go through how the coperniq system rollout is at least from the top level and pre sales to post sales. And then I use that opportunity to kind of get a sense of what you guys are doing and reach each of these components here. And then I can understand how we could transition from your current system and into our system. I would go over this first. And then I would basically do kind of an intake on your, each component of your current system of for example, how you guys generate your leads, how you guys get your proposal signs, what your accounting system is. Then you could also give me your narrative on how those work for you today and how it will be. Would that work? Perfect. Awesome. Okay. So, yeah, this is basically what I usually start off our customers with and this is kind of an end to end, right? Pre sales all the way to project creation, two different swim lanes, external systems is on our client systems. Usually bottom is coperniq usually end to end. There are two ways to go about it, right? There's two different paths. One is the green path and one is the red path. The green path is kind of where it starts right there on number one, where customers typically have a website, someone fills in a form and that form basically would be the components of that form, name, address. All that information would get passed over to coperniq. On the bottom, it creates a client request. Okay, sales reps would use that client request and basically do pipeline manage with it and essentially try to take it. You could use that request record to basically initiate a proposal and then send it over to a proposal solution on the top over here. Okay. It depends on what you use. Some customers use DocuSign. Some customers use opensolar, auroa, right? And then when that proposal goes there, you would do your designs, your finance information, you put that in there. And then at some point the salesperson gets assigned, once it's signed, it gets triggered into coperniq, and it creates a project that's one way to do it. The other way to do it is essentially where there is an external CRM system that our customer maintains, right? All the lead development and everything all happens in that CRM at some point, when the lead is ready for, a proposal gets generated in your proposal system of choice. Then when it's signed and the project gets created in coperniq that's path number two. Okay path, number three. If you guys don't use your own CRM. Or don't plan to use your CRM, or if you guys plan to just don't even use a proposal system of some sort, there's another path that's not drawn here. Essentially is the request record, same thing you would do your lead development from a customer requesting to do an installation. And then once that deal is closed, you could automatically turn that into a project into coperniq as well. That's the third way. Okay? And then after the project is created, of course, that's where the workflow picks up, right? You manage a project from there. And then during that time some milestone happens within the project. Okay, we could then also connect to, I believe you guys use qpl, we could send basically send a signal based on a certain milestone to create the customer, create a sub customer. And then also if you guys use coperniq to generate an invoice, that invoice draft invoice could be sent over to qpl, so that you could do whatever you want to do with it at your discretion. Okay? So that's essentially how the end to end works. But with this on hand, I just kind of want to get a sense of how you guys run your pre sales all the way to projects today."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. Yes. Let me. get my screen set up so I can share. Okay. So for our CRM we are using right now, sunbase, I will share that with you. We had thought that we were going to use them for everything\u2026 but it's just too buggy of a platform. It does too many things and every turn, you know, it's been, we've faced bugs but it's what it's done for me as a CRM, you know, we've gotten to define our pipeline for the CRM, you know, new leads come in. Are they actively being worked on? Do we have an appointment set once it's set? Like we have drip, this allows us to manage our drip campaigns our, you know, our SMS and email to customers and have templates around that and a cadence and can do online scheduling. So that's been good. But this CRM, then we're actually manually once we get to well. Our sales guys kind of do different things. They're either using Aurora or they're using our in house proposal tool once they get to a proposal issued. But the kind of this is the flow. What this has done for us is, you know, now I can see leads coming in from our whatever source. So I've turned off right now, all our social media marketing because we're trying to slow the lead volume coming in. So these are all just website based leads, but it breaks it down. You'll see there's organic. And then there's Google PPC. So those are the only two things that we're really actively doing right now. But I can see, you know, appointments\u2026 we're set proposals. You know, we can go, you know, I can view this by month, the leads that came in, what the source was, you know, Facebook, whatever we had those coming through. And now this data isn't all accurate because all our sales guys aren't updating the problem with having an external CRM. And then a different proposal tool is why I, what I care about most in this was it gave me visibility then to go in and look at my sold source like for the year and could tell, hey, what platform? Where was I? Where was I getting return on investment? Like Facebook? I spent an ungodly amount of money on Facebook ads, got tons of leads, only two of them converted. That was a good lesson learned like for me, you know, to be able to have the data to see, you know, what was converting, what wasn't converting. Now, this doesn't have, we have lots of phone calls that come in direct because of our ads. But this isn't capturing is our phone calls, ads that are sales that come through. This is only ones that engage through our website and the Google ads, a lot of them lead to phone calls. So, and so, but anyway, this gives you some idea of what we're doing CRM kind of what I want to be able to do reporting wise because we acquired Hawaii unified. They use clickup most of what we have here. We could just rewrite and clickup as a CRM and not have all this other complicated bits that come with this and it's pretty API easy to integrate with whatever else we want to. But that's some of what we have to work out what's going to be. We need a CRM. I need to be able to observe my funnel, see where, you know, what's my spend, you know, ultimately, I want to get to, my CAC, my customer acquisition cost and know like, you know, what am I? Spending per customer in order to get them. So here, I was able to do that. And realizing hey Facebook was pretty bad whereas Google and also SEO, you know, we're a much better source. So that's on, the other thing that we use this tool for is\u2026 our service board. So that's one thing for o M, I'll need to work out with you guys is being able to, how do we integrate service? This allows me to invoice. I'm integrated with stripe. We can send invoices in obviously then that goes, to\u2026 our bank account through stripe. It's a little more, you\u2026 know, we can't integrate this with quickbooks. The problem is then someone in quickbooks has to go in and do the invoice manually. And anyway, so that flow I'm not super happy with but the service piece, is important, so that's the main there. Then let me share our internal file name. Can I ask a quick question? Sure?"}], "_metadata": {"source": "gong", "call_id": "5629015438866153075", "category": "gong_real"}}

This is kind of the input screen, the context screen, you know, is it a self generated who's the sales Guy, you know, for this lead? All, you know, notes, that are here within this, you can task individuals, with, just by doing the app, you know, or picking, you know, creating a task. Sorry. So here, we've got history at the general intake. This is where we're capturing scope of word, notes about the project, what the customer wants, you know, all detailed information that gets in there. And then this is just our internal like note process that we're handling as, we go go through. So here's, all the customer information, you know, various owners. Sometimes we have separate signatories, so we can track that physical address. If the billing address is separate, some places, we need GPS codes because we can't the real, the address doesn't get us if they're rural enough. It's not super often. And then we keep, we take wifi, and gate codes in here. And then what kind of project is it? Is it new modify ad replace? Are there already an existing permit? If we're removing panels like, you know, basic stuff, tmk, which is the lot number we use. We reference it this, cause this can link. Now, once we have that, we can link from here, right into county details. Helps us with the permit pulling. So, basically that basic stuff, then you get to the proposal tool, and this is where you're they're picking, you know, actually let me go to, sorry. I'm going to go to one, I can actually change stuff on and\u2026 not, not mess with somebody. Okay. So here we pick the program. There's lots of different programs that have existed over time with the utility. So we need to know what program it is, cause that, impacts, you know, what we can offer and how we're implementing that. But most things are, you know, export now or there's a new, BYOD program, bring your own device, plus program why those are important has to do with how the proposal is generated in terms of what credits the customer is going to get. There, you know, and then here, it's real important that we're picking the grid voltage, because we have two, oh, eight sections on the island that's going to limit what this will control what equipment, is selectable, as someone's building out the proposal. So, all this drives our internal proposal tool. So once you pick the split phase, you know, then we can have, we have solar, several different options that we offer, in phase systems, powerwall, or savant, we don't really do solar edge, anymore. But once you pick, the bill, you can tell it to auto size. And based on that, it'll target a 95 percent of bill coverage. And so, this is what the system will propose. You know, of course, we can come in override panels, all that, and then, you know, so once it auto sizes, then you can come in and pick whatever. So here, it's recommending, for a 2000 bill, four powerwall threes, and one expansion pack, and giving us our totals, it's easy for me to come in. I can see the breakdown of how the system is generating our anticipated costs across all the various, components there, what our target margin is with a 15 percent overhead. So, those are the basics of how I get to then here. Hopefully, oh, sorry, I've got to answer some time of use questions. I can just make these up."}], "_metadata": {"source": "gong", "call_id": "5629015438866153075", "category": "gong_real"}}

We can set up the integration pretty easily for both of them at the same time. We just need to set up what the trigger is. Once that's set up. Essentially, what happens is that there are identifiable fields we could pass over from the proposal directly into the project, so that there's no double entry needed. Okay. And, you could set up whatever triggers you need. And then we could also add additional properties over time if you need to. It'll, also carry over, for example, a copy of the proposal which will go into the property as well. Okay. The idea is that once it's signed and it gets into the project, what we want to be able to set it up is that this is a, whatever is in your proposal information, there, 70 percent is filled into the project already. And then there could be an intake stage that we would use in the workflow that mozzie could set up where maybe the salesperson complete the latter, 25 percent of it or 30, complete that in. And then afterwards, that will unblock, like the next workflow\u2026 like welcome call or NTP things like that. But, yes, if you guys could commit to having your sales process for, for, for proposal, building and commitment on Aurora and open source. That will be a very easy setup information will be parked into the project. Most of them will be pre filled, salesperson fills out the rest. And maybe, whoever your ops lead is, we'll kind of do a verification and fill in the last five percent or something. And then, mozzie could set up the flow to basically take it to site survey, take it to design, or maybe even after NTP installation, so on and so forth. Well, if you've seen my videos, I'm going to spare you of a rerun because it could be a little, long, but it will be a pretty nice process after that, once the project is created and then you guys could, it sounded like you guys might, might or might not, use, qbo\u2026 the qbo will be there, for you if you need it.

You know, just when I hear that, I hear protecting margins making sure that you're not getting gouged by change orders especially later down in the pipeline, of a project, right? Because it's more costly. And I also hear just making sure that you're getting as much surface area, with your clients in terms of other services that you guys provide and also in referral, in the growth of referrals, right? So, I'm curious from that efficient standpoint because at the end of the day, Mike, you know, we are premium software. So it's not always going to be that we are the cheapest license option. That might still be the case especially when you're consolidating, let me see. So you'd be consolidating sunboy Hubspot. And then you had scheduling tools so that could be consolidated and company cam. I mean, we're looking at four softwares, you could consolidate into us, at least one of which like in terms of Hubspot, is quite heavy, right? So we could end up being a lower cost just on the license print. But I'm really focusing on this efficiency topic because where we win is, the total cost in terms of, are we saving you money from costly rework or missed rebates or delays or missed milestones or clients being unhappy.

Sorry?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No worries. It's also recorded too. So we can, you can review it or share it with Hillary, the team, what have you? So, so the client record is the parent record within copernic that's important because as I mentioned before, we cover pretty much everything aside from designs. And then we integrate with the quickbooks, we integrate with your quickbooks arap right now. And so whether it's sales or construction or service or o M monitoring or even dispatch, all of that is going to be managed under the client record. A prospect is somebody who has some sort of sales like requests or some basically an opportunity or Lee or deal that maybe the sales side is working. And then a customer is somebody who has a signed contract, whether that's from solargraph or, you know, your sales process or even maybe a dealer. And once you have a client here, you can manage the sales side on the requests and you have all of your different business lines here. So this is a service request for residential. We have installed projects here and you would rename this to all your own. You know, how you guys, how you guys name things. And\u2026 then you can also issue quotes from here. And soon towards the I think early November we're also going to allow for document signing. So this would also replace a DocuSign or whatever you use for your contracts as well as logging all of financing from invoices, from contract proposals. So that you can be able to have easy reporting on all of that. And\u2026 a project can be created in one of two ways either through running through requests, running the sales cycle, you know, dialing from here and then ultimately completing with a closed one order and a signed agreement or they can come in through our integrations\u2026 that's not list. Wait, maybe it is listed here. Yes, it is solargraph is one of our bi directionally synced proposal tools, meaning that any updates you make in coperniq, it will reflect back in solargraph in this demo environment. Opensolar is the ones that's connected. So I'll just use this as an example of how solargraph works. And we can create a trigger based on either a project stage, or a contract status change. This would follow for scanify too, so that when it's ready, you'll send to coperniq, enroll it in the right project type. You know, whether it's residential or maybe it's service work, what have you? And then we'll pull all of the default mapping for solargraph. And you can also add all of the custom mapping as well. And again full. Data synchronicity, you make changes to the even the mpu status and one side it'll reflect in the other. So it's creating that consolidated view even though you're using scanify solargraph in tandem with coperniq. Okay. I know the integrations piece was important for you. So, we just looked at the two different ways that a project can be automatically created and we're gonna, we're about to dive into how the projects look. But I also just want to quickly show you the quickbooks same thing bi directionally synced all the default mapping. And so it's tightly integrated with your accounting system. Okay? So this is the project for you. This is the 10,000 foot portfolio of all your different project workflows, or basically your business lines for install. And so here we have residential epc, we have solar and battery, and we should have services here as well. I think maybe I have a filter, or something of that effect, but you can really drill this down. So if you have multiple, if you, how many project managers do you have? Actually I should ask just one. Okay. Got it. Well, that's going to be less because you're probably going to have one man managing all your different projects. But when they come into this view, they'll be able to see what stage a project is in any details and what you display here can be filtered with the columns and they can see what type of trade or industry, or type of work that is assigned for this project. So here we see ev charger, we see some GC, we see solar and that's all good and well. But what's better is to try to ask what's preventing Sean fabro here from moving from onboarding to site survey or Keanu reeves for moving from site survey to engineering. And at a glance, I can see what work orders, that are still in progress to be to enable Keanu reeves to move forward. And so if I click on tech site audit, for example, I'll go straight to the work order. I have all the notes I, that are relevant to this work order? I can action or I can tag, the person. So I can say, you know, I can say levy what is the status of the site survey? And they would get a notification. And it makes it just very easy to action the different work orders especially if you have a leaner team, they don't have to Fish for what's next, right? Like they can see it right away. The other things here is we can have yellow slas and red slas. So it's very clear, on what is running past the acceptable time frame so that then we can zoom in and action these different in progress. And we get, we can also pin comments. So, you know, if Hillary talks to a client and she finds out that they only want email comms for some reason or there's something nuanced with the construction\u2026 plan or something of that to that effect, you can pin it. So it persists everywhere and you'll notice here on the central feed. It's also pinned or the notes are also pinned here and you can have multiple pins\u2026 great. So that's kind of like the top down view of seeing all the products but let's zoom into a specific project. So here we see for Keanu reeves that the sign on onboarding was complete. So all of these steps were finalized and that automatically opened up the site survey. In this case, it also automatically up the engineering phase and we can have conditional logic here that prevents certain work orders from being opened without the right prerequisite steps. So here we say that the plan sets are blocking DC and solar work order. So we're ensuring that, you know, we have all the guard rails on to make sure that, you know, the workflow is flowing the way it's supposed to be now, from the, when a work order or step opens, we can create a lot of automations around it which we'll see in a minute. But for example, tech, site audit can be auto assigned or trigger an auto email or text to the client or to the worker for just kind of however way you want to automate different steps or processes. And from here, I can also see the site survey. So in regards to company cam, I can see all the photos that my technician has taken in the field. I can comment on any photo and just mark it up and say, you know, hey, this photo is blurry or, hey, we need a better picture of this panel. What have you? They also have the ability to mark things up too in the field. And we can also export this. So let's do all form fields\u2026 and we can export this and share it if we need to, maybe with a financier or something like that. And once it exports\u2026 let's see Levi. I'm sorry. Can you hold on one sec? Yep. No problem. You can keep moving. You watch. All right, I'm just gonna grab this real quick. Hey, well, I'm here, I'm still watching. Okay, great. Hi, Hillary. Hi, great to meet you. So I guess I'll show you while we're on the. Topic of the site survey, this is the site survey that you can share. You can share a link, you can share it as a PDF, but it'll include all the photos and you can click into any one of these photos here. So someone can kind of inspect very easily. And the nice thing is that these get these site surveys. When techs take pictures in the field, this updates in real time and typically they would go from dispatch to review. And so your project manager, is it you, by the way, are you running the projects? No. Okay. Gotcha. Well, whoever your project manager is, when one of these site surveys goes to review, they'll get a notification and they can check the work of a site surveyor before they leave the location. And that way, let's say like, you know, this picture is taken from the wrong angle, you can have them take that picture before they move, you know, before to avoid having to send them back to avoid having to reroll a truck back to the site. Okay. Sorry about that. That's okay. Mike, we just quickly showed, I showed her, did I shoot? I wasn't on the, so I just showed her the PDF draft here or a PDF file of the site survey. You can click into these pictures. So this is company cam, right? Yeah. And then company cam. Yep. I also showed her but I mean, I also talked about how these photos will update in real time when a technician's out, but I wasn't showing Hillary. Sorry about that. I was on the other screen but because they update in real time and then they'll mark it for review for your project manager to get a notification that a site survey is ready to check, they can find if there is some sort of issue with a picture and help them avoid having to send the truck back to take, you know, a photo or get one detail that could have been avoided, right? So this is really going back to the change order metric, right? Going back to the, you know, the cost and protecting your margin on a project. This is one example of that. And let's take a look now at the workflow builder. So here's where you can customize your workflow for solar for your services. And we have these templates that's\u2026 on the left hand side field work orders, office work orders, those site capture forms. And we can for example, if I just looked up light reach and I say let's see here."}], "_metadata": {"source": "gong", "call_id": "1487977460259382269", "category": "gong_real"}}

It does already include all the information and guidance for what's required for their milestone collection, right? Or for their milestone payouts and approvals. And while we're on the topic here, I will show you it's extremely easy to edit these templates, so, or these field forms. So let's say, and I won't save it because this is tuned for light reach. But let's say you want to add a field title or a multiple select and maybe this is what services are required and it's like ground mounts, roof, mounts, battery, what have you? And so that way we can easily see and we give them a nice drop down. So there's a lot of more customization you can do here, make sure not to save my changes, but going back to the conditional logic and automation. So we talked earlier about how when one step closes, the subsequent step opens. And here on the tech site audit, we see that we have an auto assignment feature to assign a worker when it opens, but more relevant for you especially in terms of multiplying yours and Hillary's impact or your project management impact. We have automations that can make managing the project much easier. So for example, here, actually I should show you here first, you can define slas. So let's say, you know, your expectation for a site survey to be complete is two days and if it's four days past due or five days past due, then it's you know, it's red flagged and it's unacceptable and what's going on and how do we fix it, right? And we can create a let's see SLA notification. So this is saying that when the project phase SLA is violated, we're going to send an email to Mike and Hillary and what this email is going to include, it's going to say red SLA violated for this project, it can include who was assigned and it can include the start dates, the kilowatt size, the jurisdiction, any data property you have in copernic that came from solargraph, or that you added on a site survey, all of that information can be leveraged here. I\u2026 don't know if you guys were a fan of have watched like lord of the rings, but this is kind of like your eye of sauron effect, just kind of like directing your attention when there's any basically whenever there's any step or work order that's not operating flawlessly. You can you? Can highlight it for you. You know, you're on the go, you're in a meeting with lightreach, you know, you're on the job site, you don't have to worry about, you know, what is going wrong in the pipeline or what is delayed in the pipeline.

So, so we looked at how we can do internal notifications and flags. We can also notify clients. So really sky's the limit with this for you. Both, you can send, let's say, so we can trigger it on like a permitting complete and send them an email or text. And what we can just say is congratulations\u2026 permitting completed by and you can even say who was assigned\u2026 I'll, just use that for the sake. And then you can say next step will be scheduled started and scheduled with and then you can put the next assignee. And so these are automated communications. You can put to the clients. You can have an automated welcome email. You can have an automated notification when someone is on the way for a site survey, when it's completed, maybe asking them for referrals, or maybe you can do it conditionally as well. Maybe mpu was no or some other service was no, but you want to, you want to just make sure you're capturing that. So maybe after a successful install, you're sending an email that says, hey need a battery or something of that effect, right? So really the sky's the limit, with any of those communications. The other automation that we can add here is operational. So what we can say here in the event of if maybe someone needed roof work, we can create a roof work order and add it. Maybe more relevant would be an mpu. So, we can say that let's see it would be project property updated and it would be mpu, yes or no value is, yes. Then what we, the action that we would want to take is to create a work order. And that work order would be the mpu work order. And\u2026 now we're not having to think about pulling in the right type of work for a specific job. Even in the event of change orders, you can have an automated change order process where depending upon what step it's in, it automatically creates maybe a new work order for design or a new work order for permitting or what have you. So a lot of operational automations, you can create as well. And you can have conditional logic across all of this.

Gotcha."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So let's see we've got about six minutes left. I'm just gonna show you dispatch and scheduling the homeowner portal and analytics at a very high level. Okay. So here, this left hand side, these are all the work orders that when they open up and are ready to be scheduled, they will auto load on this tray. And then it's just a drag and drop to the right technician or what have you to add it to their schedule? And this is the debut. So we have a real time map. Unfortunately, it doesn't show routes in the demo environment because it's you know, it's not real technicians or anything like that. But basically, if let's say I was on route from San Francisco to Oakland here. And I'm doing this job at 1,873, that's what's assigned to me. And on my schedule for the day, a dispatcher could see this and see that my route is towards 1,873 and see this unassigned 1,842 work order and they can just assign it to me so that now we've been very efficient with dispatch dispatching resources as well. So going back to the topic of avoiding truck re, rolls this is another way that we can do that. And on top of just the cost, of sending what somebody out again for a job that was nearby where they were at already, we also increase the velocity, of the overall projects and services because we have a clean way to see nearby jobs and what should be assigned, right? Right? Okay. We can dig on the mobile app and how that looks from the technician perspective on the next call. If you feel like this is worth spending more time on. But let me just show you the homeowner portal. And then we'll just finish with analytics. Okay. So if I go to Matthew here\u2026 so every client has a homeowner portal. This would be white labeled with port sides branding your logo, your name. And so when they come into the homeowner portal, they can see the different type of work they have in progress. They can see what step it's in. They can see who's assigned, they can take action. So whether that's uploading documents or maybe, you know, in November we're going to have our own DocuSign. So maybe it's signing in documents, but they have a chat box here where they can communicate back to the central feed we were looking at earlier. They can see monitoring right now, we support enphase, solaredge and tesla, and we can send automated alerts if they are underutilized and need service. Or if they're overutilized and need storage\u2026 they can also refer and earn. So replacing like a get the referral. If if, you guys have explored that before, leave your reviews and you can also store all of their documents here. So tax documents, you know, plan sets, contracts, you can have them all in the portal. So you can limit people calling and asking about, you know, tax documents and tax season, or any other questions that we can kind of offload and push to the portal. You can also run invoices here. And one of the main things is they can opt themselves into other businesses and services. So whether it's a battery or what have you, they can request it. And this would enter them of course, as a sales lead inside of coperniq\u2026 and what's the, and I think that's everything on the homeowner portal. I like the way that looks. Yeah, yeah, perfect. We'll look even better, with your logo and it will be your own right? So yep, we can dive deeper into this. But since we have two minutes, I do want to show you quickly the analytics as well. So this is the analytics view, you know, it's interesting like, you know, when folks look at those metrics that I showed you earlier, Mike and I'll share them with Hillary too. When when they don't have visibility into there, it's harder to figure out if this is if like the juice is worth the squeeze here. But this is all meant to make it very easy and a clear picture of what's going on. So you can have multiple types of dashboards. But this one here specifically is bottlenecks by phase and this is organized by SLA like time and SLA stage. So here, for example, in permitting, everything's been in the green. Of course, that's not to say that permitting doesn't have a waiting stage because once you do all your work, you have to wait, on the permit to be approved, right? So, you know, we're in the green there. But if we look at construction even from the top down, we can see that there's a heavy red SLA violation here across projects, what's going on? And then we can click into it and it'll show us who the culprit is. So it's Hugh Jackman here four months and eight days in red SLA and I can click on Hugh Jackman. And it takes me straight to the projects. So I can make any comments. I can see who's currently assigned. And really the goal here is either to rescue the project if it's still possible and get it back on the rails or we're post morteming coaching the team, tuning our process to ensure that, you know, this doesn't happen again. Okay? And yeah, I mean, you can represent your data. It's very easy to create data but let's save that for the next time. But you can also see, let me see here like sales metrics as well. So you can have reporting upon how your like lead sources are doing, how they're performing in the pipeline and things like that. Okay. That's cool. Great. Well, I know you guys have to hop here. Curious what you guys think as far as copernix alignment with both the consolidation topic you're talking about from Hubspot, company, cam nullify and sunboy for the monitoring as well as maybe if by looking at our platform, you got a got kind of like better line of sight in terms of how we can create that efficiency for you and what it's worth from, you know, avoiding like protecting margins standpoint.

It is air call, basically your calling software that you guys use kind of like another like RingCentral. Okay? So, you guys have that right there. So, copernic has its own native phone system. It's not an air call. It's not a RingCentral, right? It's lightweight. It's really for customers to use if they want to supplement with an existing calling system or if they want to save a few bucks, they could use it. But it's a lightweight calling system that we offer in case, let's just say you don't want to use air call anymore, you could use it. Features are probably less because we're not in their business, but we just have it as a lightweight option. So that's kind of essentially how it works. It doesn't work in conjunction with your air call integration. It works separately. So, the idea is if you guys have like SMS number set up in copernic, that number, you could use that number, you could advertise it. You could have people call that number. You could add individual copernic users into that number so that those individuals could receive phone calls as well. Okay. And then essentially, when a call comes in, the outbound calls, inbound calls, it will get logged into the project so that you will have that information. We're also working on releasing transcriptions as well so that it would be, the transcript would be included in there at some point in the near future. Okay?

Okay? And then if you have another member in there, it's set to all at once right now. For example, if let's just say levy lualina, and, Courtney are on all you guys, will it will ring all at the same time if you set it to all at once or you could set it to round Robin, but it has to be, if you have a copernic app open, if you don't then it would just, it will be for anyone who has it opened.

Okay. Yeah, I think I have enough context. Thanks so much everyone to give you guys an initial look at coperniq. I think based on what you've described, it would merit a different call unless you guys happen to have an hour today which I don't think is the case, but let me share my screen and give you guys an initial look. And I think we'll I'll do my best to kind of focus in on some of the topics you guys highlighted on this initial look. But this is coperniq. We really one way to think about us is we're everything the light touches between the proposal and design software. So Aurora and your arap, in this case quickbooks. So we handle everything from sales requests and deal management to the project install to o M and monitoring. We even have a homeowner portal for you to be able to have a through line to the customer for service, which I know you mentioned the monitoring is the reason for the monitoring is so that you can scale up services\u2026 scheduling, and dispatch, of course, company cam or site captures consolidated into here. We can run field management and have instance updates when a technician's on site and then analytics across all of it. So now with a consolidated system, every data property can be reported on. And you can have kind of like your complete data integrity in here as well. And only have to update any piece of information once. And you're also eliminating that tribal knowledge issue that you had highlighted where if someone's out, someone's sick, it sounds like, you know, people are spending a day to kind of chase down the right information or chase down the person while they're under the weather. But a client is the parent record here that all of this happens under a prospect, is somebody who has come in through maybe a web form, fill Facebook lead or canvassing, what have you or a referral? And a customer is somebody who has a signed agreement. Maybe that happened in your proposal software, maybe it happened in coperniq. And then maybe the install is in progress or it's been completed. And to show you how things can get pushed to coperniq. Firstly, you can manage the sales requests in here and you can have your different lead sources so that you can report on things and also tailor the sales process based on how they're coming in or what kind of project they are looking for. And here, you can dial the customer. You can log notes, you can create appointments reminders\u2026 you know, we can have visibility in reporting. You'll notice there's a red SLA here. So we can have an eye of sauron effect where we know when things are falling out of the expected timeframe, we can run reports on it. We can create automation to keep the sales reps accountable or even just make sure that nothing's slipping through the cracks. And then once a project flows through one of these, one of these workflows to close one, that's what would trigger a project with all the relevant information. The other way is for when you're integrated with one of your proposal tools that can automatically, these are bi directionally synced as well. So if you make any updates to Aurora, it will or make out the updates in coperniq, it will reflect back to Aurora. Opensolar is what's connected in here. So this is the example I'll show you. So we can create a trigger where the contract status is completed. As an example, you have options and that's going to create the project in the correct workflow. And it's going to pull all of the default mapping we already have in the proposal tool. And you can also add custom mapping as well. So no information is missed. There's no double entry of information. You have a consolidated single source across, you know, from the proposal tool, and then throughout all of coperniq, and even towards quickbooks. And since Jason was spending some time on accounting this morning, I'll also show you the quickbooks side bi directionally synced as well. All information is going to be pushed to quickbooks, that is necessary. And so if you make any updates in quickbooks, it'll also reflect back into coperniq. And we do have on the project level, we have financial data based on your price, based on the cost for your margins and what have you as well\u2026 now? So we looked at how the two ways that projects can be automatically created. This is the project portfolio view. So this is the 10,000 foot view, all your project workflows commercial and residential, and the subsets underneath those. And so here I can see the resi, epc, we can also see services from here. So, o, M, new sites and\u2026 it's table stakes to be able to see where, like which projects are in what stage and what phase, even table stakes to be able to see the SLA notification on how many days past due. But a more productive question from this point of view is what's preventing Sean favreau here from moving from onboarding to site survey, or Kiana reeves from moving from site survey to engineering. And if I hover over in progress, I'm able to see all the work orders that need to be completed for us to move this project into the next phase. And I can actually click actually, I'll highlight too at a glance. I can also see the status and these would be your work orders. So you'd be able to see at a glance and know what's going on here. And we can click directly into any of these work orders. We have a tailored feed of notes that are pertinent or specifically related to this work order. And I can add levy and I can say, well, I guess I just did that on a demo earlier today, but you can action the work order here, change the status, what have you and then going into the direct project here. Now, we also, I want to kind of draw your guys' attention to the central feed. Going back to that tribal knowledge topic we were talking about before. Now that we're in the project, we have all notes that are related to this solar project at this site for this client. And so no context is missed and it's also kind of drilled down. So it creates more clarity of the notes feed. And we have our workflows here where when each step is completed, it'll automatically open up the next step or the next phase. And we can create conditional logic around that. So for example, we can say that the site survey is blocking design and engineering, so that we ensure that they have all their information before it opens up and gets auto assigned. We can also say that the plan sets are blocking DC solar work order. So we make sure that we have all of that completed\u2026 right? I mean, in some of the worst cases that I've heard of it's getting all the way to pto when they didn't get some critical approval in the beginning phase. So they missed a rebate or something like that. Or in just an order of operations in solar, maybe you're having to redo work or have a change order. Do also want to highlight in the notes section that if a comment is made on the specific work order, you will be able to link back. And as a theme within coperniq, you can go directly to the work order from one of these links or from wherever it's listed. And, you know, just, it's very easy to diagnose what is going on, zoom into the different work orders\u2026 here's, where a project manager would be able to review site survey information. They would be able to mark this up however way they'd like to send a message to the technician. And the whole goal of this is to when the technician completes a job and they submit a project or a site survey. For review, the project manager has an opportunity while they're still on site to check the pictures, see if a photo is blurry, see if information is missing and have the technician capture that before they leave the site to avoid a truck reroll. I'll pause there because we kind of look through the workflow, the central feed and how projects are managed, and just check how this looks from an operational efficiency standpoint, and the consolidation of or what should I say of easy access of context and information standpoint?"}], "_metadata": {"source": "gong", "call_id": "7079663811957188963", "category": "gong_real"}}

And this can be a tailored view. So the different jurisdictions or signs or however way you want to organize it in Florida and we can drag and drop these different work orders to different folks. I'll just drag and drop this. Well, it's a welcome call that's office work order. But, and in a real environment, I would be able to see a route for me as a technician on the way. This is just a demo environment. So it doesn't show that. And so let's say I was going from San Francisco to this 19 two work order. But then the dispatcher saw that there's an 1,864 work order nearby. They can auto assign that to me and that would update my route. The route would also be shared with the customer.

It sounds like they're called in between permitting installation that's extra scopes of work.

So basically, it'll be like additional scopes of because we don't start anything until permitting's complete. And then once permitting's complete, then it would automatically queue up roof, replacement, structural upgrade, trenching, all that stuff.

So that if the phase is in progress, it will add it, but if it's already completed, it won't go back and add it because you can see it can be destructed, right? And then phases, if you add a new phase in between, it really depends on where your projects are, right? If the phase, imagine if a project only has phase one and you're adding a new phase three on it. Okay. Fine. That project would just take on a new phase. But if a project already passed phase three and it's on phase five and it's still active, you add a new phase three on it, the system is going to think, oh, wait a minute.

But we do integrate with quickbooks and o M and monitoring and scheduling and dispatch. And you do have analytics across every data property with this consolidated single source of truth here. And the client can be a lead. If there's nothing attached to them, they haven't raised their hand or haven't shown any interest or have a construction project attached to them or a prospect if they have come in through maybe Facebook referral canvassing, I think in your guys's case, what's really, you know, what represents a lot of value for you both is going to be a solar company who's now interested in roofing and vice versa. And then on the customers, that is somebody who has a signed agreement and either construction that was, that is in progress or is already completed. And then you're managing the long term relationship for upsell into different business lines as it pertains to solar. Well, actually as it pertains to all business lines, you can manage through the sales request and you can have, you know, here we have a service request for residential. We could have roofing here. We can have solar. We can have Facebook. So this is really your portfolio view of all of your different lead sources and you can customize based on the lead source or the type of work that you're doing, what the stages should be. So creating guardrails for your sales guys as you onboard them. And as the project flows through the workflow, you'll be able to have work orders, plans. You can have appointments. You can dial straight from here. You could add notes. You can see emails that are to this client in the central feed here. And ultimately, when the sales request results in a closed one deal\u2026 cycle that's going to automatically create a project for you with all the details that were acquired by the sales rep. The other way, this is like what the sales guys like, what we're going to see. Yep, that's right? And they're able to see documents here. So there can be, you know, any kind of pictures or documents can be set here. You can issue quotes and proposals as well. So you can add your different line items and create a quote and actually share it. With the client in the homeowner portal or the client portal\u2026 and even see a change log here for anything that's been affected on, this feed here on the right is where you would, you will one, you would come in and see if there's any other contextual notes for the deal or conversely the project or wherever the client is or whatever this request or project object is. And in this case, let's say, you know, we're going to tag the sales rep and we're like, hey\u2026 when is the next meeting? What's the next step? And I would get a notification for this and it'd go into my queue for what I need to action. So that's the sales request side and that's how you can create projects automatically, from the sales process internal to copernic. Now, the other ways that we can automatically create projects is via integration. So we do have, because we got our start in solar, the proposal tools that are listed in my demo environment, are solar proposal tools. But if there's something that you guys use for roofing that you would want to pull projects from or anything like that, we can integrate as well. But these are bidirectionally synced. So anything updated in copernic will reflect back to open solar. In this case, John, what proposal tool are you planning or are you currently using?"}], "_metadata": {"source": "gong", "call_id": "2869791329972534818", "category": "gong_real"}}

Let's zoom out here again and look at the project actually let's before we zoom into the workflow, let's zoom out even further to this project portfolio that we were looking at before. So here you can have like your roofing business line, your o M service, just all the different business lines you can have under the project view when you're completing service or doing an installation. And you can see the different projects in the different, like what phase that they're in. You can even see what the red SLA is or yellow SLA for how much past acceptable timeframe it is. So, you know, like what urgently needs attention. But a more effective question from this project like pipeline view is what's preventing Keanu reeves from moving from site survey to engineering? And if I hover over in progress here, I can see all the work orders that need to be actions for this project in order for it to progress forward. And I can click directly into one of these work orders and it'll take me straight to it. So I can action it so I can tag whoever's assigned, means that, we can help move things along. And if we go now into the workflow process here for this project, now, I can see, okay, well, sign an onboarding phase. All the steps are completed that automatically opened up the site survey phase. And we can create automations where that's auto assigned or triggers an automated internal or external communication\u2026 via email or text. So internal might be like flagging, maybe, yeah, fly like flagging to somebody details of a project when it hits their step, external might be saying, congratulations, hey, you know, site surveys done permitting is done\u2026 initial installs on what have you, and we can create conditional logic here where the plan set in this case for this solar example is blocking the DC or solar work order. So we ensure that you always have plan sets to move forward or we could potentially add a site survey is blocking design and engineering. So they have all the pictures and information they need to actually do design and engineering. Okay? These are some examples of the guardrails we were talking about before making sure that as you add folks and maybe they're your cross training into roofing or solar, they have the necessary sop and even the technology\u2026 based.

So we can update a property or assign collaborators and we can assign the like the project manager, or the technician or whatever. And we can do it by individual person or we can do it by a team. So if I had like in this case, it'd probably be solar crews or solar install crews. And then I can add the team and it would round Robin between them that's one automation. An operational automation. We can notify clients. So that example earlier where if send from, to contact emails. So if we want to say, you know, congratulations site survey complete, and then we can use all the information we have on them, you know, their name, who\u2026 complete, who was assigned for the tech site audit? I'll just add this one just for the sake of it who's starting the next phase. What the next phase is? So that's an example of kind of an external communication and internal communication. This is actually probably one of the most valuable automations that we have. And actually I should show you that you can define your slas here. So whatever is the acceptable timeframe for yellow or red, you can define it. And then now we can create, we can report on that as well. But we can also create automation triggers. So here we say the red SLA is violated. We send an email. This is going to josh and John or josh and John, and maybe it's ccing the project manager even, and we're seeing red SLA violated, which is the project title? Who is assigned? What was the start date? What's the kilowatt size, what's the ahj, you can add any data property that you would want here. So I don't know if you guys are fans of lord of the rings at all. But this is kind of like an eye of sauron effect, right? For your company where whenever anything is out, like anything you know, is even having an inkling of going like out of rails, or after the acceptable timeframe, you can have all the information feeded to you rather than having to scour a project pipeline or ask for updates and things like that?"}], "_metadata": {"source": "gong", "call_id": "2869791329972534818", "category": "gong_real"}}

And then the other thing is just more like a sync up on Salesforce data migration and lastly operation stuff more like Huey, he already has everything lined up. So I'm not really worried about that.

We're done like you could go live with your new process. That's why I kind of want to tune into that. But before getting into that uat wise, there was a war room that happened last week.

What pops out when you fill in the form? Does it allow you to go to the next step after you fill in the form you submitted? It? Does the DocuSign contract go to the salesperson and then to the customer? Things like that? Those big muscles. So it sounds like at least from things like the causality part of the test that's happening and you could kind of see yourself living this process. Is that safe to say? Okay, and I hope the test plan that I gave you is specific enough for you to kind of feel like you have like enough real life coverage in there, right? Residential, new construction that one was started with. That one is actually, the most sophisticated one, right? Andrew starts with the big level, the big builder deals, right? He starts that off, he fills in the form and then it back office ops basically looks at his form and then basically creates the file, that file gets loaded, projects get created and sanga and team starts the projects. So that has its own tracks, right? You guys tested that, right? Okay. And then afterwards, as the projects are being worked on, you simulate a situation where, oh, a customer bought the house. So now, I'm going to go ahead and do, the energy consultation with the customer, that energy consultation gets filled out, a DocuSign contract gets submitted and then afterwards the signature happens. Then all the rest of the information shoots over. The coperniq updates the project and also changes the name of the client from the builder to the actual customer, right?

That way, it won't depend on you being on certain stages. Okay. Yeah. But do you, still, I would recommend that you keep those stages because if you guys want to do sales pipelining, you kind of want to see where your deals are, right? I think Nancy asked me. Can we just have it to contact me all the way to close one? I'd be like, yeah, you could technically do that as well, but if Marilyn were to look at your deals right now, I'd be like, okay, where is this deal? Oh, contact? It's either open or it's closed, you know, but you want to see if it's in the discovery phase or if it's on the contract phase, Marilyn, you want to see that, right? That's the whole point of having a sales pipeline review, right? So we could set it up. It's an easy change. So, you want to set it up so that we keep the piece of tracker on the request, but you want all those forms and everything just to be automatically there. So you don't have to wait, go to the step and do it. The reason why I was just trying to be like kind of appropriate and perfect meaning. Oh, that form should only pop up when you hit a certain stage, but I get that you could want to start it earlier. So I could make that change for you.

But, if you're saying that you could get to a comfortable level, it means that next week, it could just be residual work or whatever. We're still in good shape, right? At least on paper, I think what did I say in the email? I was hoping that to be able to say for all of us to achieve this goal of having the systems process ready to be used outside of data migration, saying this process is ready by like I think, the week of the twentieth for example. So it's not like walls are closing in on you yet, but I'm just trying to get a gauge of that. Sounds like we're pacing pretty well, essentially. So if we could try to aim towards wrapping up and let's just say a vast majority of 85 plus percent of your templates, good. Then next week, we start off in pretty good shape in terms of kind of tuning and kind of finishing off of the residuals of the testing, doing flight check on all this other stuff. And then by the week of the twentieth this month, we could tell, you know, all together, tell Adam, I say it looks like the process is on the silver platter, this process is ready. And then Sean will also work with you guys to finish loading the data. So you could in addition to new projects that might come from the, that might come along, you could also use it for old projects as well. So I can't see the dates I put on email, but essentially, we want to be able to do this process done hopefully by this week or next week. And then also validate the Salesforce data this by Wednesday of next week and then trying to start loading it next Thursday. That's kind of the goal. Again, it's, I have no screen. I can't see my email right now, but I think we're doing alright. Actually. Okay. Yeah, I'll continue to paste it. You, you hear me nagging for the next couple of weeks for sure. But I, I'm looking at this right now, it's it seems we're we, it seems we're doing alright, because the key thing is that from Amanda, from Andrew, from you guys, you tested it, you see the flow. It's going back and forth. There's water going in. The quality of the water is what we're trying to test right now. So, okay\u2026 that's really all I have, but I think the other one that we really want to work in parallel if you can, is essentially after Sean publishes the sample data from your Salesforce, probably by tomorrow or so, we want to really start validating those records, basically, looking at each of these records and say, hey, this is what it looks, right? It's meaningful to us and we can work off of these, get an approval and then Sean will open the floodgates for the rest of the projects.

So, after kind of the changes with itc and residential and clients, you know, over the last, year and a half blowing up, right? We, you know, the last six months have really been pivoting into more commercial specialty trades and contractors. It's been interesting because the low voltage electrical contractors seem\u2026 to respond to our advertisements. I've had a few."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Well, in our world, I mean, I think in defense of that, like I've been in business for 22 years now and there is, I've used corego or, you know, I guess it was servicom back in the day and then it had a lot of limitations but then they, well, servicom got sold. I don't even know if they're still around but irrelevant, it was very much a manual entry product where you had to enter every damn thing possible and it was a good start but it was terrible. It was honestly terrible. And then we lost millions of dollars just in, you know, lost revenue and lost billing because the work orders weren't updated the right way and we had to copy and paste from that to invoices. It was, it was ridiculous. It's like using a big spreadsheet and then we use some online stuff for a while, there kind of got rid of it. And then I guess it's probably been about three years. We use simpro out of Australia. Yeah. And it actually is great for field service management. It was designed for the electrical industry, but it has some serious limitations when you're integrating with other accounting software, any accounting software. So, and that's not good, you know, because we have to, we have to be able to integrate line item to line item. And because I have people that use quickbooks for all the accounting stuff and they don't do anything with the, you know, the scheduling software type stuff. And if it doesn't integrate perfectly, they can't read data the right way. Yeah. So in seeing your software, that was one of my first questions is like, I know that it was designed for the solar world, you know, obviously in the solar world, it is some electrical. I mean, I actually got solar trained 15 years ago but decided not to do it in Texas just because it's all in gas country. So it doesn't really work as well here. Yeah. But I mean, it works well, but nobody wants to buy. And so\u2026 one of our biggest things is just we're to the point where simpro does work. Okay? I mean, it works actually, it works fine. But we're having to use estimating software with simpro software with account\u2026 with quickbooks to get them to work. And it's a lot of double entry. I have to enter everything into the estimating software. Then I have to enter it again in the, in simpro. And then I have to enter it again in quickbooks, and, that right there just a waste of energy. And so we have found software that kind of, that combines the estimating and the scheduling side of stuff. But their estimating is really top notch, but their scheduling is not. And I was thinking in my mind, I was like, look if I found, a company that has great scheduling software but the API can somewhat be not open but tied together with another company, then I can create workarounds in order to be able to go through and tie the stuff together or talk to each manufacturer and get them to talk to each other and see if this, if y'all would be interested in creating a link between, you know, different brands in order to make it so that they work seamlessly instead of using zapier or something like that, just actually creating a little link between the two companies. So that's kind of like where I'm at right now. And for you, I, since I saw it online, it looked interesting, but that's as far as I got. And then my, I didn't go and research, does it integrate fully with accounting software? I didn't check that at all."}], "_metadata": {"source": "gong", "call_id": "870963921178141704", "category": "gong_real"}}

And of course, we're hooked up to the solar proposals we will have signing shortly. One thing that's nice is a lot of people like the white labeled customer portal scheduling and dispatch is nice especially since we have a native mobile app. So when the team's headed there, they can give the customer a good experience, let them know they're on the way day of, you can see where the team's at. You can even toggle it with, you know, undispatched orders.

Yeah, the reporting's pretty straightforward, very robust.

So I think we're starting to hone in on, you know, what are those ideal ways to use our software that are specific to low voltage contractors, right? Because we've had a few from Florida. We even had a Guy we were talking to in the northwest, which was interesting, their business exactly like yours high end home, you know, more residential, not as much commercial on the automation and audio video.

I'm the BDR so I just, you know, just to make sure there's a fit. One thing I'd like to learn. Can you tell me a little more because you do like the field app and I don't want to battle with our native mobile app, but there are some benefits. So you'll have to decide and look at that, but how is it used in the field by the guys? The simpro?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "They use a mobile app. So it's you know, we schedule in the office and then they, it's basically the work orders. You know, we use a scheduling board and we can drop an ad wherever we want to. It has the ability to tag materials to it. You know, it tracks the labor obviously for time in time out, drive time. It doesn't send notifications to customers unless we want it to. We just didn't do that because it's not a setting that they can choose. It's a setting that we would have to set up in the office that every time they click on a button, it would send a note to the customer. Well, we have products that go on for a month and we don't want to be hitting the customers up with a damn note every time they press a button, you know, saying you're en route. So it's not selectable. The workflows are pretty damn good, you know, like if I, if we have a job where we got to buy material and we order the material, then it's got workflows where it says, you know, purchase order placed. And then when the material comes in, we'd click on another button that says purchase order received. And they'll send emails out to the project manager in the scheduling department saying, hey schedule this call. So, I mean actually from that standpoint, that's what I'm saying it's actually a great product. Simpro does work really well. The problem is that it does not integrate with quickbooks at all. I mean, it does, but it doesn't integrate that we need it to. And then the integration and that's where for me to you, it's like it's got to be one to one. So if the label is a model number a by this manufacturer in simpro, when it downloads into\u2026 quickbooks, it just says material. It doesn't say what it is. And so it won't integrate item to item for whatever reason. I don't understand why it doesn't but it doesn't and they know that it doesn't so it'll still track the numbers, right? But it doesn't track any of the inventory properly because it just says finished sales or electrical sales or low voltage sales. It doesn't say the unit number. So it makes it difficult. And the other thing that it doesn't do is that we have multiple tiers of pricing, you know, because we have security which is at a 35 point margin. Then we have electrical, which is sometimes at a 25 point margin. But if it's a service call it's at a 50 point margin. And then we have audio video, which is MSRP or SRP. So, you know, because we have those four different pricing tiers, it doesn't\u2026 it's a lot of manual entry in order to go through and change the pricing tiers on a ticket. If you want to invoice out of that ticket, like you literally have to log in and say, use this sales price.

Okay? And that project is going to be governed by a workflow that I set for you guys. All right? And I'm going to show you how that workflow looks like in a moment. Okay. All right. So the workflow is this, you go to company settings and then you go to project workflows. I created this master residential workflow. So right now, we're going to focus on the full installation first. Okay. So if I click that, you see this workflow right here, I've broken it down to these phases. This is our best practice. This is kind of what most customers do although I kind of changed it up a little bit. Okay? Someone's trying to keep on getting to the call. Okay? Never mind. So the phases are discovery site, survey, design, NTP\u2026 permitting construction inspection, pto, and then closeout. Okay. That's what I set up the phases.

But since that hasn't happened yet, I created these fields for you so that you could start using it, but we may have to change it. That's what I mean. So, yes. But this is again just best practice from Sean. Might be able to use these fields as well. And whatever salespeople enter. For example, if you have panels or inverter, we could have those automatically come over here and it will be pre filled right here. Okay. Does that make sense? Okay? That's the goal, right? But again, talking to raze yesterday, we just want to be able to put together something so you can start using it. And then next couple of weeks, we want to work on that whole integration on that pipeline with Sean. Okay. So when you fill in this contract verification form again, some of them might be pre populated from subcontractor hub already in the near future. Okay? And the rest of them, you just have to make sure you fill in. Okay? When everything in discovery is completed, it goes into site survey, right? You could dispatch someone to go to do a site survey. And this is the shared work order here. So the office person will have to call the customer, set up a time. They have to add a visit date on this work order here. And then they would have to assign a crew member on this work order here. Okay? And then a crew member will go over there. They will be assigned, they would get an automated message and say, hey, you need to go to. So, and so site, this is what it will look like for the crew member. You see this right here. So, at some point, when this is dispatch, which I will show you later, the crew member will go on their phone and they will see, oh, I got work order number 16. I need to go to three eight, nine post street and I need to do these things right here. And this is the work order. For example, these are instructions. This is what I need to do right here. This is my visit. Okay. I need to basically click on the way and then go there and do my work, click clock in and do my work essentially. But this is just an example right here. And this is not a tech survey, but this is an example that I pulled out from a, a, what do you call that? An installation? Essentially? Okay? But this work order is currently blocked and that's I'll get into that in a moment. All right. But just to give you a few, there's going to be an app that the field crew members or Rais will be using to basically work on this stuff on this work order, follow so far. Yes. Okay. And then when the texture site survey is done, essentially the site on a tech site survey, what they would, someone needs to do is basically complete a energize site survey form. This site survey form, Jake is taken from what you gave me, the proposal that you showed me on all the information that is needed right here. Okay. Once it's basically, typed in or photos are saved, it will be saved into the folder of the project. See this looks familiar to you, right? So, yeah. Okay. So I did that, this is essentially your one pager that you're talking about after the site survey is done. So, if the crew member is taking some photos over here, whoever does that one pager, it just needs to finish the rest of it. They don't need to start all over. Okay. So that's how it's set up right now. I set it up so that you see right here on this energize site survey. If you hover above this right here, you see that this form is linked to the tech site survey.

I'll click on this right here. And this is what you see. The first you notice only one phase is open up here. You see discovery. It entered on 10 eight. It's not exiting yet. It's going to start the clock. It's going to tell you how long it's in that phase. From now on, you see sales rep, crystal owner, crystal here.

It's missing because the form hasn't been filled out yet for the contract for the verification. Got it. So that's why the first phase needs to commence first. So, right now, the way we set up this work order is the sales rep, Jake probably received an email and says, hey, Jake. You need to do these things here, Jake, right? So you need to reveal this, you need to call, get a written approval, blah, blah, blah, these things right here. Okay. As you are doing it for this work order, you need to check this off. Okay. But at the same time, best practice, sales people, if they begin work or anybody beginning work should click, is there a fire alarm right now? Give me a moment. Okay. Sorry about that. No worries. I don't think it's this floor yet. Otherwise people will start coming to me and say, get out of here. Okay? So if I'm work, Jake, if I'm working on this, put it to working essentially so that if anybody wants to run a progress report on any work order, you see what status it's in. If you're being blocked, mark it to move to waiting. Okay? If you're going back to work, put it back to working. Okay? So these statuses are important because they're being blocked.

I'm going to complete this whole thing now. So site survey is done. So what's the last thing I need to pay Reyes? Now, so the last item you need to do is, okay, let's go ahead and make sure tech site survey is complete. It is offline. I'm going to process a payment for Reyes. I did that. Once I'm done. Okay, I'm going to mark this complete as well. Now the site survey phase is complete, you move on to design engineering. Whoever engineering is again would get a default response and our default note that says, hey, so, and so is assigned. In this case again because the workflow template is not first responder, no one there, but I could put someone in there right now. Okay. This is pretending it's Andy, for example, Andy has to do these things in this. Right here, there's a plan set for example. So Andy's doing his cats and everything. So he knows that this plan set needs to be loaded. So I have some pre stamped plans. Let's just pretend it's this one here. I'll load it in there. Okay? But it's not done yet. But I need to do my other things too. But I did the first version, right? And at some point, I'm sorry, I forgot to mark again. Click start working. That's very important. I keep forgetting that click start working and let's just say someone's reviewing and you could put it to move to waiting. Now, let's just say at some point the plans are approved, I got the final plan set. Go back to the form over here. I'm going to put my final plan set here. That's done. Okay, mark, complete form is done. Okay. So now I have to go back to my work order and say, okay, I did the rest of the stuff here. And now I could let's just say I could choose to, depending on your process. I could choose to send this send\u2026 to review and assign whoever then needs to review it or I just mark it complete. That's your choice. But you have two things that you could choose to do. I can mark this complete here. See engineering. Plan sets are done. Now, if I want to do prepare work scope or whatever, there's another work order that needs to be done here. You could do that as well, but I'm going to defer to you to add steps on this if you need to or any type of forms where you need to upload documents in there, you could do that too, but I can work with you on that crystal. Okay? But, you know, notice down here all the stuff about your concerns earlier about the plan set. It's uploaded construction's not even started yet.

We'll try to delete it and just make a new one at 11, you know, for 30 minutes whatever because we'll probably need to like if this time works for everyone, it works for me, but I expect us to maybe take less, start taking less and less time with these and maybe have it be more like if there is an agenda, we can discuss it if not like maybe we can do a biweekly or whatever we'll figure it out. I probably for the first couple of weeks Gerard will need extra help. But at the same time Gerard is getting seems to be getting up to speed fast. So, matt\u2026 like one thing for you real quick just in terms of what I draw and I have been having meetings Monday. We had a meeting just to get Gerard up to speed on the event and everything on the competitive landscape. Yesterday. We met talking about what has to be done this week because I described the ads as fatiguing, Gerard pushed back. We clarified like quality is going right? Cost per MQL is getting, you know, too expensive. So the goal for Friday is to refresh copy and creative and make some small tactical tweaks based on the learnings from both what's resonating with these new target audiences and also being able to actually address them by name and not just hey commercial but be more like, hey electrical, hey, roofing, hey mechanical, right? Hey commercial mechanical. We should keep commercial Gerard because commercials clearly are like that's the build up service trade angle. But like, hey, commercial mechanical, commercial, this commercial insert industry name. So that's the plan for Friday. And I think Gerard already had some examples, right? So that's kind of like priority zero right now just to buy us more time next week to kind of like, you know, keep diving deep and thinking about what's the next, you know, low hanging fruit. But I'll let maybe Gerard, you add anything.

Because it's kind of like either we, in my opinion and this I think is matt, I don't know if it's tactical or strategic, but like we need to have like a cadence where every four weeks, I don't know what the quantum, what the cycle is, maybe two weeks. The last batch of ads lasted us almost five to six. So maybe four weeks can be like the cadence. We need to make sure we have copy creative always fresh always like, you know, kind of syndicated to all channels. So while it can seem a little bit like in the weeds, I'd rather we got in the weeds and did maybe one all together with Gerard with everything. So that in the future, we never, this is one thing that we never talk about manufacturing these squares every four weeks is just something that happens. We don't talk about it. We assume it's just like one of the boring things that was totally operationalized, right? So that's why, like, you know, if you actually don't mind like let's get a little bit like more hands on just because so that we never have to talk about it again, right? Like kind of how matt actually tried to operationalize it in the past, matt had a good spreadsheet that I've shared with you Gerard, which is like copy creative votes some excel formulas for length and trimming characters and stuff. And then that feeding basically the, it used to be Miro. I've shared with Gerard now a figma so that we can basically don't have to take screenshots from the design canvas to the Miro. We can just do it in the design canvas, but basically trying to operationalize this. So my only question here is, and Gerard, to you really do we want to try to do like a greatest hits kind of thing? What I mean by that is literally just rephrase a little bit, move some words around, move some images around different gradients and just launch that or do you want to do a little bit more of like wait, we can actually do something a little bit more radically different.

And then once I have enough time and I kind of get into, you know, ad account pixel and everything, then I'll try out new stuff and I think my process would be, I'll just let these campaigns, you know, that are performing good. I'll let keep this campaign active and I'll create some new campaigns to try out some new things, you know, which I shared with you the other day.

This right here is\u2026 first of all, we now know our icp, it's no longer. Hey, commercial contractors of the world. It is people doing electrical. Yeah, we still can't crack the code on people that are doing big electrical, but we seem to be resonating with low voltage. We are definitely not for audio visual. That's a dying thing. All this like smart home bullshit. We've tried, it just was a waste of time. We were absolutely for people that are doing security cameras, fire and light sprinklers, all this kind of like low voltage, electrical stuff, beautiful fit, roofing number one fit, by far and then, mechanical, but again, commercial heavy and all our, commercial heavy.

We can figure out the tags but this is the level of let's say distance, right? Like it doesn't have to be. Yeah, I see radically different it can. I actually don't like this layout. It's very busy but my point is this was like if I have to spend 10 minutes doing this, I'm just going to do this and freaking launch and then give Tim shit for not getting people on, right? Like I'm focusing on the long tail. So this is it, I'm going to stop sharing. I think we're on the same page now, but Gerard definitely do this other more like a fundamental stuff just on a medium horizon and medium like short term is 24 hours. Medium here is like Monday, right? But, you know, just pick your battles. Okay? Anything else? Matt, like I think we're on the same kind of same page. Yeah. Okay. Then Gerard, should you work with like, should you just do this with Maria? Should you just tell Maria like all the assets on that figma page that we have, right? They are actually freaking good enough. The only caveat here is that ideally we blur some things out like there's too much fine details, but it looks like these, the networks are forgiving. They don't squint and see anyways, it's kind of blurry anyways. So the bar is like incredibly low. Maybe you just work with Maria to first of all, everything should follow copy. So you should come up with three four copy, you know, creative combos and then have Maria for you shuffle probably from these four things which like are four killer things. The mobile app, I don't know if we want to do the portal or not. It's up to you to see the portal performance, absolutely killer feature. The fact that we're project centric and we give them show them the big bucks. The fact that we are field service management, absolutely a killer feature systems and asset monitoring again is up to you for you to see whether, you know, that's something that's resonating or if it just brings trash, right?

And we're not even catering to mechanical competitors like construction competitors, trades, competitors. It's just a blend of solar, all competitors house call pro, or Aurora, open solar, whatever. So that's like kind of weak weekly, adjacent search volume, you know, whatever some are competitors, some are integration, some are. And then the last campaign is, adjacent search terms like, oh, people are searching for a project management, you know, what those are, the three like super lazy kind of right now campaigns, do you see any low hanging fruit? And do you want to do anything about that once meta is up? Of course, or we keep it like this. And then next week we do Google ads kind of like a full two point, oh, post Gerard?"}], "_metadata": {"source": "gong", "call_id": "3885896479572762277", "category": "gong_real"}}

You, you need to install pixel because you have to start sharing data, with Facebook but not exactly sharing that data at the moment. And if you're you don't get that level of the algorithm won't be able to optimize itself, you know, because we have to hear, this is our thank you page. This is our, you know, like conversion event. We need more of the, I think that's one of the other pieces remarketing ad as well. It's it's just like we were discussing yesterday, people, they come on our website or they complete our signup form and that's it. We just depend a lot on our, you know, on our sales person or BDR or just, you know, Abdullah to do his thing. But we're not really nurturing those users. So, I would like to, you know, nurture those users for at least 30 to 45 days of that. Maybe don't not spend that much money. A slight touch is very important. So, that's why I kind of need Facebook pixel on our website and I'll install that using tag manager and all that. So, I think that's that. And then after that, I'll focus on Google ad for sure. I think we can try out some campaigns based on those new, you know, industry that we have opened up based on those keywords, we'll need to definitely install conversion event and everything.

And then getting the ops around meta with events and stuff that's a no brainer that's already in motion. Let's assume that's done next thing from there. Before even doing any optimization of Google ads. We are getting some like volume on Google ads and people are booking. We know it anecdotally, but we still don't have, anything updating like, from those conversions or maybe we do, Robbie, if someone converts like in your zaps, do you update the latest source to, paid search, or we just do website that's the thing, right? We don't basically have, we still don't have like utm parameters in the sense that Gerard, did someone just fill out the form because they filled out the form? Or did they fill out the form because they, converted once on Facebook? Then went and then redid it again. We know that happens anecdotally because we see the slack patterns or did they just like click on a Google ad and then fill out the form? Or last, but not least where they just literally searching for copernic because their friend told them, cause they use us, right? We still don't have like, so before I think we do any kind of further, iteration, we need to baseline, what is the current, like basically attribution, right? What is actually genuinely coming from paid search? What is genuinely coming from organic search?

We have a soft conversion where if they're on the landing page, they just put their email Rabia, right? And then we have a hard conversion, which is they actually do a full form fill. Maybe we also have after the form filled the booking like almost like three levels of seriousness, right? Like, is that right? So there's actually three, there's three distinct conversions and ideally people can kind of stack them and do all of them. But my point is Gerard, for none of those things. Do we know right now? Was this organic? Was this paid from an ad? If, so, which ad, or was this, did they redirect from a different network? Did they cross pollinate kind of from LinkedIn or meta that's what we need? We just need to know this, we don't know this. So we don't know, do we double the budget on Google ads or do we shut down but Google ads? Because we have no idea what, the only thing we know is, we know we can ask them and some people have said, yeah, I clicked on an ad or we can just infer from the patterns on slack and then about channel, neither are, good enough, right? So you understand the mission, we can worry about this next week just before you start doing anything with keywords, positive, negative, any structure, do this foundation, right?

We'll call you back and just, we have a beautiful website, just get them to the website and we'll pay the drop off in people jumping changing their mind. But at least the people that do follow through on the website, they'll just do the calendar shit, right? So, I want everyone to think like radically, maybe it's time to take them to the website and stop. Obviously, at that point, the question is like meta obviously wants to convert them there, and maybe the drop off will be crazy like we can get conspiratorial and conclude that it's not worth it. Let's still do it on meta. But I know that meta now has a calendar integration, right? Like maybe the solution to this is they just book something and it pops on their calendar softly.

I can definitely like copy paste the content and like work on it, Polish it a bit more and then copy paste it to the template that we have right now for the product update, the cadence newsletter we were working on.

I mean we don't have, we have case studies, Robbie, bill, case studies, but I don't think he studies at this point, this should hopefully my hypothesis is there are people in the CRM that are too shy to ask for a demo or forgot we exist and are severely underestimating the momentum and the speed with which we build. And this email is just one last thing to get them over the fence and just to book the damn, a damn demo and see it. We won't bite them, you know? So that's my hypothesis.

Then he will load and then he will load sample records into coperniq, and then you guys will validate those sample records once that's good. Then he does the full load. But that's the assumption that the sample records are representative of all other records as well, right? So, the validation process, the, basically the, the mapping and getting the sample data in and the validation process takes the most time. Essentially, I try to budget a two week validation process, meaning you guys look and then you say something is right, something is wrong and Sean will iterate it for you and keep on doing iterations. Usually, I would budget a two week process for that. In this case, here we're the reason why I'm saying last week is because I, in my mind, I'm still thinking 10 31 go live, right? So work backwards.

Essentially, you can use the resource button to kind of filter out the individual who is going to be going to that site, right? If you want to do it by team, what you will have to do is like for example, you got the service work order here. You click it. And if you want to assign the entire team again, it just means that one person will be dropped into the assignee, one person will be dropped into the collaborators. So if I do, for example, like the sales, you have a sales team. I see. So I do that the sales team only has Jordan right now, but if Jordan has an underling somewhere, that person would just be dropped over here and they will both get the notification saying, hey, go to this site and do your work. That's how it would be. But if you, we have this little nifty little dispatch tool here where you could actually do drag and drops with certain people who you deem as workers, but you could only do that for individuals.

It's being blocked by, okay. Maybe that's not a good example. What I'm going to do is I'm just going to do a fake work order and I'm going to put it on other. Just so I have an example. Okay. So I got this work order right here. Okay. Let's just say I'm the scheduler, I talked to the customer. Coperniq says, hey, you know, I got a date. Do you feel like you're good for the tenth of this month at a certain time? Okay. Two PM to three P. M. Okay. So I got that. I got this work order that's scheduled. But you notice it's a schedule right here. And there's no assigning yet that's how it should be. Okay, because if an assigning gets dropped in there, it becomes dispatch, meaning that worker is expected to go to the site and the customer is expecting you. But if you have a collaborator in there only with a time, meaning a scheduler or a project manager that's okay, that doesn't fire a notice out to anybody. Okay. So this work order is scheduled. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to the dispatch here. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to status. I want a work order that has a status of schedule. This is the one I was created earlier. So essentially that's the tray that has work orders that's already. You see there's a little time in there already, right? You could, it's not final yet. You could still drop it on any time. But imagine a bucket right here that shows all the jobs or somebody already got into their phone call. They're pretty good. So essentially, what you now could do now is choose resource with only your workers in there. Let's just pretend Sean C and Michael, right? This view here now has these two again, I'm just designating you guys as workers right now, I could actually drag it into a specific time on a day, or if I go to the day view, I could pick the time, the exact time that I want and dispatch it. And that will finalize the visit. And you could also save this view. Since you guys have regions, right? You could save this view so that you could every single time you have a scheduled job on the left and on the right, it will always be Michael and Sean C, meaning that you could actually create a region of workers, save that view so that it's say this is the northwest region for dispatching, or this is the southeast region for dispatching and all the workers will be different.

So essentially, let's go try here. We pick this project. You got this project right here for this site, right? Let's just say the sales rep has an upsell opportunity. Then for this site here, for this customer, maybe they could go into sales, add a request record, punch in the information and say, oh, this is the potential value. I'm confident I could sell this. This is the sales rep. At least you could work off of that request record. After that request record's created. Then the salesperson essentially works off of this sales tab right here.
